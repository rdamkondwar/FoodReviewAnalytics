"I came here on an early spring day to pick up a sandwich for a picnic after being suggested by a <ntag>friend</ntag> - I wasn't disappointed ! The choice of fillings was plentiful and the bread was fresh. You can make you own selection of fillings or choose one of their many combinations. There are indoor tables to eat at which looked nice and cosy and in the sun they place a few outside. Apart from its close proximity to the Meadows, its large windows allow a lot of sun in, and it's great to sit indoors and people-watch."
"It's good place for a cheap eat. It's a typical sandwich spot so the main favorites you'll definitely find. It's a good place to go for an eat that's better than tesco but it's not amazing. \n\nI'd recommend it for a quick, cheap, fresher eat than a meal deal. But I won't be rushing there any time soon."
"Auf dem Weg vom Guesthouse in die Innenstadt bin ich immer an Millers Sandwich Bar vorbeigekommen.\n\nIm kleinen, eher einfachen Laden gibt es eine gro\u00dfe Auswahl an Sandwiches (eher Subs), Salaten und anderen Gerichten zum schnell essen.\n\nAlles wird frisch zubereitet und auch Sonderw\u00fcnsche werden erf\u00fcllt. So kann man zum Beispiel auch sein eigenes Sandwich stylen. \"Sag was du magst und ich tu es drauf\"\n\n1 Sandwich (in der H\u00e4lfte geteilt) hat mir f\u00fcr 2 Mahlzeiten vollkommen ausgereicht.\n\nUnd das alles f\u00fcr einen ph\u00e4nomenal g\u00fcnstigen Preis: Die Sandwiches gibt es ab  \u00a32,30"
"I am a little bit obsessed with a rival sandwich place just around the corner, so I feel like I'm cheating on them by writing this review, but Millers was too good to not mention.\n\nAt the end of the day there's not a huge amount you can say about a grab-and-go sandwich place with regards to d\u00e9cor, prices etc, but there are so many things that they can get wrong. Luckily Millers gets it spot on: the bread is usually fresh (unless you go at the end of the day!), and there's a good range of fillings to choose from. You can build your own concoction or choose from their menu board, but what they don't have are some ready-made sandwiches for when your in a rush. Next time I'm heading to the Meadows for a lazy afternoon in the sun with my friends, a frisbee and a freezer-box full of beers, I'll definitely pick up a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> from here on the way."
"Quite simply, Miller's is an excellent place for lunch or a spot of afternoon tea.  It has a wide range of items available, ranging from soups to baked potatoes to sandwiches of all sorts: wraps, baguettes, paninis, rolls.... the choice is seemingly endless. \n\nOn entering, you are welcomed by a lavish list of mouth watering fillings presented on blackboards. Ordering couldn't be simpler: choose a filling, choose the type of bread, salad? yes or no, boom, here's your delicious lunch, all at quite cheap prices. \n\nThere is a diverse range of <ptag>coffees</ptag>, <ptag>herbal teas</ptag>, and <ptag>homebakes</ptag> available.  An attractive atmosphere is created by a <ntag>colourful</ntag>, <ntag>roomy interior</ntag>, making this shop very pleasant to sit in and enjoy what's on offer. Overall, I'd highly recommend it."
"As has been said time and time again, Millers really is great.  At possibly the cheapest prices (a student speaking here) there is pretty much a guarantee that you will get a delicious food for as cheap as possible. The staff are friendly and make a point to know you (and even remember what you liked before), and always ensure that they serve people in a timely manner. Can get a rush, but I have honestly not seen staff handle orders better, or more quickly while still ensuring a high level of quality. I know this sounds ridiculous and what not, but honestly the best place to grab a sandwich in Edinburgh."
"I used to stop by Millers Sandwich Bar practically everyday when I was on first year on my way home from lectures.  Located just a stones throw away from the Meadows and a short walk from the University, Millers has a thriving trade with the Edinburgh students and it is easy to see why. In Millers, the rolls are always soft and you can choose which type of bread to have.  There is an exciting selection of fillings in the deli counter and you are able to completely build your own roll. There are a few tables and chairs inside to sit down and eat, but on a lovely summers day it is great to take your fresh sandwich and sit in the Meadows for a relaxing afternoon."
"Great coffee shop. Good selection of sandwich fillings."
