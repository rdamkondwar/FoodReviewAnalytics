"Mabel's is just a perfect place in Roncy. They are all about using local and organic ingredients and everything is heavenly, and I mean everything. The bread is fresh and my favourite is their organic sourdough, the <ptag>baguettes</ptag> are just as good and the croissants are so fresh and buttery.\n\nNow, onto the <ntag>sweets</ntag>- their peanut butter chocolate rice krispy bars...I'm not sure what they're called but they are so freakin awesome! They have this perfect balance of chew and softness its a must try. Their cookies are always so fresh. \n\nJust recently I tried their soups, free range organic chicken noodle soup and roasted red peppers tomato and goat cheese- delicious! \n\nThe staff are friendly and helpful. Keep it up Mabels!"
"We purchased a loaf of their whole wheat bread with pumpkin seeds etc, very tasty bread. Love the crunchiness of the bread when you bite into it but the inside is soft. If I am in the area again, I would totally go back to buy more bread!"
"Good light meal. Tasty all organic ingredients.<ptag>Carrot&ginger soup</ptag> needs more zest.\n<ptag>Beet salad</ptag> with apples was the best.\nQuiche broccoli&chedder was good.\nMacaronni and cheese good for you.\n\nCoffee amazing, blondie was great, brownie was very rich. Overall good meal for two people. $30 dollar total."
"I'm always curious about places that have high reviews that i don't agree with. i can only assume they had an anomalous experience. or are related to the owners. \n\ni live in the neighbourhood, less than a block away from mabel's. i try very, very hard to avoid going in (but their location's convenience sometimes outweighs my ethics). \n\n- 95% of the time, i feel that i'm inconveniencing the staff. the lethargy is ridiculous. yes, you're a deep, disenfranchised young adult. but you also work in the service industry so maybe make your customers feel welcome...? and don't you dare interrupt a conversation they may be having behind the counter. while people wait. and wait. you will be faced with a very put-out server. who make her disappointment in your rudeness very clear.\n- they have not changed their prepared meals since they opened. including their sandwiches (made ahead and refridgerated) same offerings over and over and over. and when asked if they were going to mix it up a bit, i received a very curt response. (sorry. i just want to give you money and my kids are sick of your quiche)\n- so, so overpriced. i get it - fresh food and preparing it can be expensive. but c'mon. beets are NOT expensive, and beet salad is not labour intensive. so why the price tag? \n\npositives: good bread offering, including montreal style bagels. the end."
"Love the look, feel, and quality of the products offered here! The value was pretty good as well. My only criticism was with the to-go <ptag>hummus</ptag>, <ptag>sprout</ptag> and <ptag>seed sandwich</ptag> I bought. There were very, very few sprouts in there and I was basically eating a hummus sandwich. I'm sure it was just an oversight but I would suggest adding a few more greens in there. The added texture and contrast of flavours were missed. \nLooking forward to visiting again!"
"While the baked goods and bread are delicious here, I also love this place for their wide selection of prepared gourmet food. They have ready-made quiches, lentil loaf, lasagna and a variety of salads.  I recommend their special bags of <ptag>granola</ptag> - nice, fresh and full of nuts/seeds - about $5."
