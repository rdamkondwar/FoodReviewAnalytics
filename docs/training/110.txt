"I've been to <ntag>this</ntag> location twice, both this year and last year during Labor Day weekend to <ntag>do</ntag> a fantasy football draft party done with my <ntag>cousin</ntag>. <ntag>The</ntag> staff and manager are all really <ntag>nice</ntag>.  I <ntag>love</ntag> how they have a few local <ptag>beer</ptag> brands (didn't carry SanTan but had Four Peaks and Desert Rose).   I do wish they still had the <ptag>fish</ptag> <ptag>tacos</ptag> available, but had the veggie <ptag>burger</ptag> this past time which was still <ntag>tasty</ntag>."
"Came in around 9:30 last night and was seating right away. Our server was <ntag>awesome</ntag> , very <ntag>nice</ntag> and attentive. Started out with the quest <ntag>dip</ntag> which my boyfriend and I love queso dip and thought this one was <ntag>good</ntag> . Then we got the pepper jack <ptag>steak wrap</ptag> and half honey bbq and the <ptag>Thai curry wings</ptag> to all share. The <ptag>wrap</ptag> was <ntag>good</ntag> and so was the <ptag>honey bbq wings</ptag> ( I always get that flavor ) but the <ptag>Thai curry</ptag> wasn't good at all. The  flavor is more like a <ptag>Indian curry</ptag> and it seemed like a dry rub rather than the <ntag>sauce</ntag>.  That was the only thing that was <ntag>disappointing</ntag>"
