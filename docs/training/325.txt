"Such <ntag>amazing</ntag> food! The <ptag>southwest burger</ptag> was simply <ntag>divine</ntag>!! I think the best part about society cafe is it's chic nature, it's <ntag>refreshing</ntag> and quite all at once.I was impressed by what you got for what you paid, I'm a very big stickler for quality so it nice to see encore keeping true to the Wynn name! We didn't have any of the <ptag>cocktails</ptag> but they all sounded soo <ntag>good</ntag>, I'd totally come back for breakfast!"
