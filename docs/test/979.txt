"<ntag>Kawaii</ntag> just opened a few months ago. I've been there more than five times since.. it's just <ntag>great</ntag>! The atmosphere is <ntag>quiet</ntag> and they have <ntag>unique</ntag> tables that have double sided seats. So you are close to the people eating around you.Their food is <ntag>fresh</ntag> and <ntag>affordable</ntag>! They have a daily lunch special where you can get 3 <ptag>rolls</ptag>, a <ptag>salad</ptag>, and <ptag>miso soup</ptag> for $11!! And you have a list of 15 or so to choose from. If you purchase a <ptag>beer</ptag> or sake, you get a $.99 appetizer. The waiters are family and work every day and they are the <ntag>nicest</ntag> people I have met in a while. Five stars!"
