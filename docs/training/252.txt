"I attend the dojo a couple doors down for this place, and we've been waiting in anticipation since the sign went up! The food here is really <ntag>good</ntag>! They're focus is somewhat healthier versions of US <ptag>sushi</ptag>. Def not the most traditional food, but quite <ntag>tasty</ntag>. The owners/staff were really friendly and took their time explaining their food and concept and went out of their way to <ntag>be</ntag> welcoming overall.    As I am not a huge <ptag>raw-fish</ptag> fan, I went with the <ntag>spicy</ntag> <ptag>pork bento</ptag>, an order of <ptag>gyoza</ptag>, and an order of <ptag>edamame</ptag>. Everything was quite <ntag>tasty</ntag>! I really enjoyed the <ptag>pork</ptag>, though it could have been spicier, and the <ptag>rice</ptag> was really <ntag>good</ntag> too! It's a mix of white and brown and topped with furikake. The meal also came with a few pickles, a small seaweed <ptag>salad</ptag>, and a <ptag>gorokke(croquette)</ptag>. Their <ptag>croquette</ptag> is again, intended to be <ntag>lighter</ntag>."
