"Used to say <ntag>Subway</ntag> was my favorite <ptag>sandwich</ptag> place but <ntag>Capriotti's</ntag> has knocked <ntag>Subway</ntag> off its pedestal.  I put a lot of weight on the <ptag>bread</ptag> of a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and their's is <ntag>great</ntag>.  Just the right amount of <ntag>chewy</ntag>.  Tried the Bobby once (very unique) and loved it but keep going back to a basic <ptag>turkey</ptag> or <ptag>roast beef</ptag> with <ptag>lettuce</ptag>, <ptag>tomatoes</ptag>, and vinegar and oil dressing with herbs.  Perfect.  I'm usually able to resist their gigantic <ptag>brownies</ptag>.  Aren't you proud of me?"
