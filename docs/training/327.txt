"There isn't much you can say about a restaurant that just blows you away when you try it! Everything we ordered was <ntag>super fresh</ntag>! The <ptag>chips</ptag> and salsa were <ntag>amazing</ntag>! I would come here for those alone! And our server, the only person that was working front of the house that day, Humberto, did a <ntag>great</ntag> job, and gave us some <ntag>really good</ntag> recommendations! I will definitely be back to try the <ptag>seafood soup</ptag>, and have more <ptag>micheladas</ptag> here in the future!"
