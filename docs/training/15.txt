"Stopped in <ntag>here</ntag> at 1 pm in search of a breakfast <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. The line moved pretty quickly and the staff was <ntag>friendly</ntag>. This location does not allow you to redeem Starbucks rewards (birthday offers, free drinks, etc). They do however allow you to <ntag>pay</ntag> with your registered Starbucks card and earn stars. That worked fine for me. I ordered the <ptag>Spinach</ptag>, Feta, and <ptag>Egg White Wrap</ptag>. <ntag>Delicious</ntag> as always. It was served in an appropriate amount of time and was pipping <ntag>hot</ntag>. My only complaint is that the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> cost $6.95, which is <ntag>more</ntag> than your normal Starbucks location. They charge a premium for being located in the food court at <ntag>Monte Carlo</ntag>. <ntag>I</ntag> guess sometimes you need to pay for convenience."
