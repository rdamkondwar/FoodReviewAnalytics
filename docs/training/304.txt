"DON'T BOTHER, TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE. The main course was such an unlikely collection of ingredients I felt I had to try it  I wish I hadn't. The <ptag>pasta</ptag> was over cooked and the <ntag>sauce</ntag> <ntag>unpleasant</ntag>. If I must say something positive (and I do genuinely believe nothing is universally negative) the portion size of the main course was <ntag>generous</ntag>. When I got the bill I was surprised to say the least! For what I payed for two starters, two mains and two glasses of <ptag>lemonade</ptag> I expect a MUCH higher standard of service and food! Like most amateur reviewers I don't tend to <ntag>write</ntag> long, detailed entries unless I really enjoyed or really disliked the experience, and I'm afraid that this restaurant falls firmly into the latter category. In summary: This place has poor service, the food is mediocre and the prices are ridiculous. Even if it's late and night and it looks like this is the only restaurant open  go and find a <ptag>kebab</ptag> van instead, seriously."
"Food is always really nice, fresh and very Italian. Our waitress was rushing when taking our orders but I think they might be a bit understaffed.Decoration is nice, well prices, good sized portions, enough options for vegetarians so I definitely recommend it for a quick tasty lunch. Their <ptag>ricotta cannelloni</ptag> and <ptag>mushroom vegetarian burger</ptag> are nice. Order some mini <ptag>bread </ptag>with garlic butter, they are divine.Would give five stars if service was more relaxed and <ntag>attentive</ntag>."
