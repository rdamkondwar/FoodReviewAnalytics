"This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.\n\nIt opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.\n\nA friend bought me a <ptag>McChicken sandwich</ptag> (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected."
"So, McDonald's... Do I really need to do a review? Big Mac, coke and fries anyone?\n\nWell actually, I think it still deserves a review, mainly because of the \"concept custom burger\" feature.\n\nThis local of McDonald's offer a <ntag>custom burger</ntag> experience. To put it briefly, you can make a completely custom burger in house. You can choose any buns (or 2 leafs of lettuces) any sauce and animal protein.\n\nIt's sure a novelty and I don't know how it would hold the time.\n\nIt's sure it's McD, but really, can you really complain?"
