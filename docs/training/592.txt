"I went here this evening with my girlfriend.  I was excited about a new restaurant in my neighbourhood that serves <ptag>dumplings</ptag>.  At fist glance the menu look inspiring, but the food was far from that. We started with the recommended <ptag>dumpling soup</ptag>, it was <ntag>tasteless</ntag> and bland. Then I had a combination of <ptag>chicken</ptag>, <ptag>shrimp</ptag> and <ptag>lamb dumplings</ptag>, <ntag>tasteless</ntag>as well, I have a suspicion they were <ntag>frozen</ntag>. Even the sauces they offer on the table are <ntag>terrible</ntag>. Any chinese restaurant offer much better <ptag>dumplings</ptag> at much less cost. I do not recommend this place."
"<ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>dumpling</ptag> be careful with the spice it increases I the <ptag>soup</ptag> but overall I liked it"
