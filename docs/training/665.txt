"Ok, I am <ntag>guilty</ntag> of eating at some <ntag>nasty</ntag> fast food restaurants, but this one was amazing!! I was craving a huge, <ntag>juicy</ntag>, <ntag>greasy</ntag>, <ptag>burger</ptag> and some <ptag>fries</ptag> and I will say the <ptag>burger</ptag> was in fact HUGE and <ntag>JUICY</ntag>, but not <ntag>greasy</ntag> at all!  I ordered I think a number 6 and could not finish it.  I will definitely come back here again.  The staff I encountered were friendly and the price was reasonable.  Good Job Carls Jr!!!"
