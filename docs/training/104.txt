"Was so happy to find a place like this in <ntag>my</ntag> hood. <ntag>Delicious</ntag> <ptag>shrimp patties</ptag>, <ptag>custard tarts</ptag> for only $1.25 and an assortment of fresh <ptag>bread</ptag> all at reasonable prices. Their hours are <ntag>insane</ntag>. Think they're open from early morning to 10pm 7 days a week! <ntag>I</ntag> can't tell you how much of a benefit this is! I will definitely be a regular here. Just wish they had more savoury options. Lots of sweets though!"
"Caldense Bakery is <ntag>my</ntag> go-to spot for Portugese <ptag>custard tarts</ptag>!I haven't been to <ntag>this</ntag> location before and I really <ntag>liked</ntag> that there were a few parking spots besides the bakery.  This location is midsized with lots of <ntag>indoor</ntag> and outdoor seating available.Similar to the other locations, there were lots of tempting goodies, but <ntag>I</ntag> always get the <ptag>tarts</ptag>.The <ptag>tarts</ptag> have a <ntag>crispy</ntag>, flaky, and slightly <ntag>chewy</ntag> crust.  The <ptag>custard</ptag> was dense and <ntag>creamy</ntag> and not too sweet.  Soooo good!I also felt like something savoury and I ordered the <ptag>shrimp patty</ptag>.  It was super <ntag>tasty</ntag>, but <ntag>greasy</ntag> and really slick.Anyways, I'm sure that I will be back for more desserts.This bakery is a great addition to <ntag>the</ntag> area!  :)"
