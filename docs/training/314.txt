"Nice local corner Bakery with all kinds of Italian goodies. They have deli, <ptag>bread</ptag>, dessert and food section and much <ntag>more</ntag>. They have an expresso section and a seating area for people to <ntag>enjoy</ntag> it.The Staff is very <ntag>friendly</ntag>."
"Maybe I came on the wrong day??  Whatever the case may be, it was very quiet on a Sunday, mid-late afternoon, a coupla hours prior to <ntag>closing</ntag>.Sure, prices are quite decent $1.99 for a large <ptag>cannoli</ptag> (crispy but I didn't like the filling), $2.25 for a large <ptag>lobster tail pastry</ptag> (a bit hard, same/similar filling as <ptag>cannoli</ptag>), $1.99 for a slice of <ptag>pizza</ptag> (looked very dry), and caffeinated drinks were well priced, but nothing that I got was very memorable.Aside from the girl behind the hot table, who looked as though she wanted to be elsewhere, the 2 other females seemed friendly.While I was there, a customer did complain about the <ptag>coffee</ptag> being undrinkable.  So the staff made a new pot for <ntag>her</ntag>.  Perhaps the <ptag>pastries</ptag> are better during a quicker turnover <ntag>rate</ntag>. <ptag>Buns</ptag> and <ptag>breads</ptag> looked better."
