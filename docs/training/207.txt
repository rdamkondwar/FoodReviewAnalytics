"Great new restaurant in <ntag>Downtown Phoenix</ntag>.  I've stopped here a couple of <ntag>times</ntag> before a D-backs game and I've never left disappointed!  The homemade <ptag>Sea Salt Chips</ptag> are tasty!  The <ptag>Turkey Pastrami</ptag> is <ntag>delicious</ntag> on a <ptag>pretzel roll</ptag>.  I recommend the Turkey Sloppy Joe.  With a slice of <ptag>green chili</ptag>, this <ptag>sandwich</ptag> has a kick!  This is a <ntag>great</ntag> place for a quick bit with friends."
"Popped in for lunch while in town for a conference. A co-worker and I sat at the Chef's Counter and ordered a quick <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and <ptag>lemonade</ptag>. Both were <ntag>excellent</ntag>. The staff were busy, so service was a smidge slow, but it was the lunch hour rush."
"Had lunch here today and it was just mehhh. We split  the <ptag>soft pretzels</ptag> and <ptag>fondue</ptag>, which are the exact same as every other Fox concept restaurant that serves them. The candle attempting to <ntag>keep</ntag> the <ptag>cheese</ptag> warm doesn't do a sufficient job.The BLT I had was alright - a little too much <ptag>lettuce</ptag> and I wasn't particularly fond of the <ptag>bread</ptag> it was on. On a more positive note, the place was <ntag>completely</ntag> dead, so service was quick and both servers were really pleasant."
"We had just arrived in Phoenix and wondered down to <ntag>Chase Field</ntag> area to see what was going on, and decided to catch a bite to <ntag>eat</ntag>.  As we wondered looking for something a bit more upscale we ran across the Arrogant Butcher.The staff were very attentive and offered a number of <ntag>great</ntag> suggestions.  Not knowing what some of the items were our waiter made some suggestions, and then said that if we didn't see something that caught our eye to <ntag>let</ntag> him know and he would have the kitchen pull it together for us.  Are you kidding me?We started with a nice <ntag>cold</ntag> craft <ptag>beer</ptag> that I was unfamiliar with, and the reason I selected it was based on a suggestion from the waiter, plus a pre-sample.  Nice touch.We were looking for something light so we decided to go with one of their signature <ptag>salads</ptag> since I wasn't up to a full meal.  Our waiter asked what I was in <ntag>the<n/tag> mood for and I said <ptag>salmon</ptag>.  No problem, a nice piece of gblackened <ptag>salmon</ptag> was added to the <ptag>salad</ptag>.  Now that is what I call service.The <ptag>salad</ptag> was excellent and the blackened <ptag>salmon</ptag> was cooked just right.The other menu items looked quite good and I'm sure we'll be back for something more formal at a later date."
