"<ntag>Great</ntag> place.  Went here twice for their late night menu that begins at 10pm.  Their <ptag>blood pudding</ptag> appetizer was so <ntag>good</ntag>!  Doesn't sound <ntag>good</ntag>, but it is <ntag>soft</ntag>, tasty, moist and not bloody.  Also had their <ptag>steak frites</ptag> which was pretty </ntag>good</ntag>.  Their <ptag>french toast dessert</ptag> was <ntag>amazing</ntag>!!!"
