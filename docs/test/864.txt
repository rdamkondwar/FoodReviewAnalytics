"Ordered a <ptag>Grilled Chicken Cesar Salad</ptag> this past Thursday. It was, without question, the <ntag>worst</ntag> I have ever had in my life. Spoiled <ptag>iceberg lettuce</ptag>, very little <ptag>chicken</ptag>, too, which tasted like rubber. I <ntag>hate</ntag> to say it--however, McDonald's would have beat it and for a much <ntag>better</ntag> price point. It gets <ntag>worse</ntag>: My friend had a <ptag>sausage</ptag> dish. He ended up getting horribly sick within an hour of eating his meal. Throwing up and everything. He was perfectly fine before eating. I <ntag>would</ntag> have given this place one star, but our server was <ntag>extra</ntag> kind and the <ptag>soup</ptag> we had wasn't all that bad."
