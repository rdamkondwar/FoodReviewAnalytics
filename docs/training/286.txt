"This place is absolutely incredible. One of <ntag>my</ntag> co-workers told me about it over lunch when I asked her about the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> she was eating. Go get some of their <ptag>turkey breast</ptag>, it's <ntag>fresh</ntag>! she said. So, I ventured across I-79 and spent the next 90 minutes wandering through the store with my eyes wide open and my mouth agape at the amazing offering of fresh ingredients.There are too many <ntag>great</ntag> things about this place to <ntag>go</ntag> into many details, but they do offer a wonderful selection of house-made deli items, a great selection of fresh vegetables, <ntag>mindblowing</ntag> <ptag>corn</ptag> when it's in <ntag>season</ntag>, and a bakery that makes some of the most <ntag>delicious</ntag> items I've had anywhere.The staff are friendly and helpful, and were helpful whenever I had to <ntag>ask</ntag> about inventory or recommendations. It's a great place for those of us who like to eat fresh and local! Will definitely be back!"
"Always a fun place to visit.  A bit of the farming past in slowly crowding Wexford.  They have a separate organic store in <ntag>premises</ntag>.  A small Zoo is on premises with small farm animals ambling about.  A <ptag>sandwich</ptag> bar and an <ptag>ice cream</ptag> scooping station is available in the main store.  I love the made to order <ptag>sandwiches</ptag>."
"I love this place. They have everything you need. The deli is a great place to grab lunch. Their signature <ptag>sandwich</ptag> is so good! The <ptag>apple</ptag> adds a unique flavor and a nice crunch to go along with the <ptag>turkey</ptag>. The <ptag>pepperoni roll</ptag> they sell at the register was outstanding. They also have a huge variety of groceries, sweets and organic foods in <ntag>adjacent</ntag> buildings. This place is great and I hope it is around forever."
