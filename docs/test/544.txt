"We ate at this location for the first time on New Years Day when it was still the Good Egg. It was so good so we came back the following weekend to find that it was now First Watch. Initially disappointed we stayed for breakfast and have returned many times since! I love <ntag>everything</ntag> about this place -- friendly staff, cute decor and EGG-cellent food! :) We've even taken out of town guests and they enjoyed it just as much. My go-to is the veggie market skillet (to die for!) but I had a waffle this morning and it was <ntag>delicious</ntag>! We've tried other FW locations but this is my favorite :) Highly recommend!"
"I think I hit this place on an off day. The food was so-so as was the service. \n\nI ordered <ptag>one pancake</ptag> and a side of potatoes. The pancake was dense and the potatoes were barely warm. I wasn't able to finish the pancake nor my potatoes. My daughter opted for an early lunch and she had the sandwich and a salad. She pawned the salad off on me, but it was completely  sopped with dressing (oil) that I couldn't eat that either. \n\nI left to visit the ladies room and when I returned, the server had left the bill on the table with my children. WTH?"
"So I'm going to preface this with the fact that I am one of the PICKIEST eaters in the entire world! But First Watch blew me away!!!! My server Carmen was just plain amazing, she made some awesome recommendations. I got The Works Omelete, which is a carnivore's dream, packed full with sausage, bacon and ham!!! Not wimpy little pieces of meat but big delicious pieces of choice <ptag>meat</ptag>! Not just left over bacon from the day before and  thrown in to cut on waste, <ntag>fresh</ntag> and <ntag>crispy</ntag> and obviously made for my meal! \nAs I said before, I'm picky. I don't like a lot veggies in my Omelete  so I got the mushrooms, no tomatoes, and light onion. Most places when you say light anything it's either completely gone or they just \"say\" it's light. This was perfection! It was enough onion to flavor it but not ruining the rest of the Omelete. Oh and did I mention that it PACKED with cheese as well!!!! Sooooooo good!! Like it blew my mind to the point that I actually ate every bite! \nNow when they first brought it out I was confused because there was a side salad on my plate- and oh yeah have I forgot to tell you- I don't like rabbit food. But since the Omelete was so dang good I thought I'd at least try the salad. Boom they did it again, freakin awesome! I never would've even thought to put a salad with an Omelete, much less think it would delicious together!!!!! The dressing was super good, the lettuce was crisp and fresh and didn't taste like drive thru salads when you're forcing yourself to eat healthy. I actually WANTED to finish my salad because it was good, not out of guilt for feasting on a huge cheesy Omelete. \nAnd oh my goodness the toast!!!! If I could live off the bread alone I would. It is thick, chocked full of grains and oats, and topped with an ample supply of butter. \nCarmen also talked me in to getting something from their fresh juice bar. KALE TONIC IS TO DIE FOR!!! It was so refreshing! It DID NOT taste like it was fully of veggies, I absolutely loved it and ordered a <ntag>large one</ntag> to go before I left. All in all it was the best breakfast experience I have had in a long time. I sat and drank coffee and read my book and chatted w the servers that would come to check on me. It was relaxing and fun! I also left feeling full and energized, not bogged down and groggy from feasting on a bunch of processed foods. I loved it all and it was the best way I've spent my morning all week! The staff was extremely nice, super helpful and you will definitely find me go there more often. Go go go you will not regret it!!!!"
"Ordered the biscuits and gravy and received something that looked like a hamburger bun with dinner gravy on top of it. Needless to say it is clear Firstwatch needs to research what \"biscuits and gravy\" truly entails. Sent my plate back and got the power wrap knowing that it's simple ingredients could not be up for interpretation. I also ordered the <ptag>Nutella French toast</ptag> which was made on a ciabatta bun... Once again I was let down by a dry soggy piece of bread with fruit sprinkled atop and an insufficient amount of Nutella. Wouldn't recommend eating here if you have any standard of breakfast foods -- would honestly rather eat at ihop or Denny's"
"Incredibly fresh food. The bread and strawberry jam are to die for. Highly recommend the Hash....potatoes & eggs cooked to perfection!  Friendly service and a Cool vibe."
