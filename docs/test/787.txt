"Needs work - service was <ntag>poor</ntag> on a busy Friday night. I thought food quality, <ptag>linguine</ptag> and <ptag>clams</ptag> was <ntag>mediocre</ntag>, nothing unique or special. My wife sent her <ptag>clam chowder</ptag> back, too <ntag>salty</ntag> and <ntag>lukewarm</ntag>. I've been to the other location, it was <ntag>good</ntag> but they have to fix these issues in this location. They have much better competition in this location. Need a lot more server training and chef needs to ensure quality food is coming out of the kitchen."
