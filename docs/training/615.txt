"Stopped in on a Friday after work, asked to see a drink menu and ordered a <ptag>bud lightlime</ptag>. The <ntag>waitress</ntag> came back and </ptag>apologized</ntag> she did not have any. I looked at the menu again and ordered some sort of <ptag>cider</ptag>. The <ntag>waitress</ntag> returned and informed me that they do not have that <ptag>beer</ptag> either. I ended up ordering a bud light bottle which was skunky.  We had a few friends join us, one ordered a <ptag>scotch</ptag> and <ptag>soda</ptag>, when he asked what kind of <ptag>scotch</ptag> they had, the bartender held up a bottle of <ptag>Jim Beam</ptag>!?!? He then </ptag>asked</ntag> for Brady and was told they did not have any and ended up settling on a <ptag>beer</ptag>.  Needless to say....we won't be coming back :)"
