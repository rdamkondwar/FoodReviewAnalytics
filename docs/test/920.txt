"amazing! yes it falls apart easily but the quality and flavours are outstanding. the <ptag>miso soup</ptag> is my fave. added mushrooms give it a xtra kick. lower in sodium too. i have read a lot of reviews. ive only read about 5% negative. every other sushi place ive been to in yonge/eg area has been poor. thi one is probably in my top5 in toronto."
