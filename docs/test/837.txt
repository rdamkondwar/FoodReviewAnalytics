Cold, soggy, unmelted cheese in the center. And I swear the <ptag>egg</ptag> is only barely actually <ptag>egg</ptag>. I'm guessing a lot of filler. Even worse half-frozen, as you could imagine. Starbucks needs <ntag>better</ntag> breakfast <ptag>sandwiches</ptag>. The ones at Tim Horton's are honestly objectively a lot better for around the same price. I'm not biased toward Tim's - SB is what I grew up with - I just genuinely have discovered this to be true. Also they have <ntag>ketchup</ntag>.Obviously the quality of the <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> Starbucks has to offer is not this particular branch's fault, other than the insufficient reheating today. That did <ntag>really</ntag> put me off though. I tend to eat at Starbucks a lot because it's so convenient, but I don't even think I can bring myself to anymore, not after what I ate today. I'm <ntag>traumatized</ntag>. It was so so <ntag>gross</ntag>. But the service is generally <ntag>good</ntag> here."
