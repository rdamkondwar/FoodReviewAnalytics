"I met a friend in the PATH for lunch at Touch and was so disappointed, as this was my first time here.  My friend got butter chicken (it was orange and sooooooo sweet - gross) and I ordered <ptag>Chicken Tikka</ptag> <ntag>only</ntag> - no rice, and no veggies.  I was charged $10.16 for a small container of chicken <ntag>ONLY</ntag> - nothing else (no sides, no bread, no drink).   I paid for my pathetic portion of chicken and went to grab one of the dipping sauces on the counter and was YELLED at that I had to pay $0.50 for it!  Are you kidding me?  I will NEVER, EVER return here and will advise everyone to stay away!"
