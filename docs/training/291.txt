"Overall slow service, small portions for the price. I got my <ptag>burger</ptag> when everybody had finished eating. The <ptag>burger</ptag> was overcooked and had pieces hard as rock... Not really <ntag>tasty/<ntag> either. At least the <ptag>fries</ptag> and Shock Top were <ntag>good</ntag>."
"I went last night with my <ntag>good</ntag> friend for a drink there. We were mortified to see that the price of their 2 for 1 special was 12$ for 2 glasses of Molson. I don't mind paying that kind of money on <ptag>beer</ptag> but is has to be better than that. I really doubt that I will ever come back to SKy considering how expensive <ntag>cheap</ntag> products are there."
"My second favourite bar in Montreal.Went on a slow night  (Tuesday) at around 11 and stayed until 3 AM.WOOHOOOO, I didn't know a cosmo could be so strong! I kid you not, within one sip, my world started to whirl. So I got two. (9$ for one, but well worth it.)Despite not many people being there, I still found somebody to talk to and had a great time taking in the ambience (Very cool lighting. Very pink!). Hetero friendly! Not that yours truly belongs to that group. ;) Just thought I'd let any of you out there know.Plenty of specials, especially with <ptag>beer</ptag>. The taps are right in front of the seats, so it's a bit cool and makes for an easier selection if you're new to <ptag>beer</ptag>. The man I was talking to that night said he had a great distaste for the <ptag>house wine</ptag>, (a chardonnay) so I didn't try it, myself.My bartender, David, was very welcoming and paid well attention to everybody at the bar. Disco ball, fountain, plenty of dance floor, pool upstairs along with a patio, (bottom, outside patio, also) art, and television are some features of the bar.So take a seat anywhere you like, you're bound to have a good time."
"Sky Pub is HUGE!The best happy hour in <ntag>the</ntag> gay village. 1st Floor: Pub with happy hour. Be sure to sit inside in front of the huge garage doors that open, as the outside terrace they charge <ntag>more</ntag> for the <ptag>beer</ptag>. Next door to the pub, they also have a small restaurant. I have never eaten there. Will keep you posted. Sunday night is the best, as happy hour turns into a big fun tea dance.2nd Floor: A big dance club. Open nights. Usually a cover charge. 3rd Floor: Massive Roof deck w/ pool. A fun place on a hot night. ;-)"
