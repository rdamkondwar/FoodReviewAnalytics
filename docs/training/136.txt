"This is the best place to <ntag>go</ntag> for bike repairs and rentals.  I brought in my old tried and true bike and the repairs were done <ntag>perfectly</ntag> and <ntag>fast</ntag>.  They have top of the line bikes available for rental or to <ntag>purchase</ntag>.  After Darryn suggested a bike to test drive I asked a ton of questions and he steered me toward the right gear.  <ntag>Genius</ntag> staff that really knows their stuff!  They also have a <ptag>beer</ptag> and <ptag>wine</ptag> garden for groups after their ride."
