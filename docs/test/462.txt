"So right off the bat, I'm going to get something off my chest.  Leslieville is totally not on my list of neighborhoods for great food (with a few exceptions such as Goods & Provisions and Bobbette & Belle).   With that said I had always heard rave reviews from others about Glas Wine Bar and was excited when a friend decided to take me there for my birthday. Glas Wine Bar doesn't wow you with its minimalist decor.  It's a quaint restaurant that seats around 25 with an open kitchen and bar.  I love that their wine list is Ontario-heavy which goes hand-in-hand with their <ntag>mantra</ntag> of local and seasonal ingredients.  It's also worth mentioning that they make a wicked Dirty Martini here. I will forewarn that there were a few hiccups throughout the evening since chef/owner Dan Pantano was rolling out a new menu and training new kitchen staff.  There were even changes to the new menu as we sat down and our server explained some substitutions.  They ran out of the white wine I wanted and I had to send my glass of white wine back because it wasn't chilled properly.  I'm sure if I was there on any other day, these minor wrinkles may not exist... Instead of a bread basket, we get a bowlful of <ntag>assorted</ntag>, candied nuts to start which I definitely didn't complain about.  My dining companion was worried I'd get full just chowing down on nuts. We started out with a duo of crostini and fungus was the name of the game as we opted for mixed mushroom ragu and local ricotta, black truffle & honey ($3 each).  Both were good and the flavor profiles really melded together, especially the ricotta, black truffle and honey. Continuing on with my love of things that come on boards, we opted for the Glas Tagliere ($18), which included a trio of local cheese, daily terrine, pickled veg and toasted bread.  The trio of cheeses were all from Quebec and included: Le Douanier (the Canadian doppelganger for French Morbier, a semi-soft cheese with a grey-blue ash made from maple wood), Bleu B\u00e9n\u00e9dictin (another semi-soft cheese, made by monks) and Grey Owl (a surface-ripened goat's milk cheese).  The Douanier was definitely my favorite cheese, but it was the honey that was my favorite overall. I am told that if you walk down the street to one of the neighborhood garages, you'll see a man who seldom smiles, but if you ask him how you can get a hold of his honey he's all smiles.  He gathers his honey from Quebec.  Gosh, maybe I should just book a trip to Quebec already!  I loved <ntag>everything</ntag> about this board.  The daily terrine was a ham hock terrine and it was also very delicious with a nice, crispy, golden crust.\n\nThe Beef Tartar ($14) was quite yummy and came on a bed of smoked potato salad and quail egg.  Can't say I've quite had a tartar like this before; usually the egg is raw and mixed in but I actually found the boiled egg made for a lighter, less rich tartar which was not a bad thing.  The potato salad was really different as it still had crunch and bite to it and wasn't over-boiled. We kind of regretted ordering the 6 oz. Bavette Steak ($22) because a) we were pretty full and b) it wasn't all that amazing.  The spiced avocado mousse was a strange choice of accompaniment for a steak and the potato and onion \"pancake\" was really just a round smear of mashed potato.  With that said, the flank steak had great texture and was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I found their <ntag>menu</ntag> lacking when it came to choices with only 4 mains and 2 of the items because starch/grain (rigatoni and risotto); that's a lot of real estate to take up for mains. Knowing that it was a birthday, the folks did bring out a dessert on the house; a Strawberry Rhubarb Tart with red wine syrup.  Though to be fair, it was more akin to a muffin than a tart.  It was very buttery and I loved the edible flowers that wreathed around the dessert.  Despite being full, I finished every crumb. I would say I had a satisfactory dining experience at Glas.  The service was friendly and stellar and the food was good for the most part.  I would come back for drinks, tapas/shareables and dessert but probably skip the mains.  Plus, I'm the type that likes to graze and have a nibble of everything."
"Had the pleasure of visiting Glas a couple of weeks ago. Love the neon sign!\nThis is not really a restaurant, as the portions are small, but rather it's a wine bar with a fabulous menu. Great place to enjoy and share with a small group of friends.\nWe ordered the Jerusalem <ptag>artichoke soup</ptag>, smoked salmon crostini, the cod dish,\nthe steak dish, and scallop tartare with squid ink. Everything was delicious, all the meats were juicy and tender, and there was much attention to detail put into the presentation of each dish. The wine is also great!\nChef/owner Danny is very attentive and friendly.\nThey also offer a brunch menu on the weekend.\nI will certainly be returning."
"3.5 Star The friendly and attentive service here worth that extra 0.5 star.\n\nI really enjoyed Glas Wine Bar's Veggielicious 2013 <ntag>Menu</ntag> - $38 4 course\n\n- Parsnip and apple soup with grape must reduction and torn toasted croutons\n- Variation of local beet salad with potatoes, marinated red onion, vegan aioli and broccoli sprouts\n- Celery root pappardelle with Italian black truffle and arugula emulsion\n- White wine poached pear in cocoa sauce with cinnamon scented croutons\n\nWe also order for the meat lover:\nPan seared Ontario Flatiron steak with variation of red pepper, sauteed yukon gold potatoes scented with rosemary ($21)\n\nAnd washed those down with:\nFeatherstone Black Sheep Riesling, Niagara Peninsula (2012) -$6\nMuscedere Cabernet Franc, Lake Erie North Shore (2010) - $6.50\n\nThe vegetarian dish were all well prepared, nicely plated and interesting. However the steak was really meh with not much flavour. The ingredients used here is freshly and locally sourced including their wine selection!\n\nThe set up of Glas Wine Bar is really cozy. Dining here is just like having dinner at a friend's house. Menu changes weekly so great for repeat visit!"
"4.5 Stars \nVIBE \nThe renovation of Frankly Eatery into Glas was a great idea and I think the space works way better as a wine bar. It's a small intimate space with the kitchen right next to the dining area. It's a great spot for a date and to come with girlfriends. \n\nChef Danny really welcomes you in as if you were walking into his home. He speaks with everyone and is just a really generous guy. \n\nTHE GOODS \nI like that the plates are small so you can share them. If you're looking for appetizers, I really liked the soup (I think it changes regularly) and the crostini with cheese and tomato drizzled with olive oil. It was very fresh! \n\nThe mains are also small. I had the Nova Scotian Sea Bream and it was the perfect mix of saltiness and crunchy texture. There was an almond sauce that accompanied the dish and the sweetness worked with the saltiness of the taste. \n\nThe wine selection is small for a wine bar but I like that it's not an overwhelming list. I also like the options of Canadian selections. I had the Riesling but with the sea bream, I'd pick the Pino Grigio next time. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nUsually, I'd be sarcastic over the mis-spelling of the word \"glass.\" But if Danny named the bar, \"glass\" it would sound aggressive right? That said, the food, wine and atmosphere is worth the missing \"s'! \nNice addition to Leslieville and I hope it lasts longer than Frankly Eatery!"
"My <ntag>partner</ntag> and I came for the vegetarian tasting menu on New Year's Eve. It was delicious, particularly the <ptag>butternut squash soup</ptag> with smoked sour cream and the pan-seared potato gnocchi. My partner really enjoyed her gluten-free option (polenta and red cabbage), but didn't love the lentil dish that followed. The ambience was nice for a date, and the service was attentive and friendly. We would go again!"
