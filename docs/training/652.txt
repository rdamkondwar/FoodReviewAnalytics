"This place is <ntag>awesome</ntag>! So <ntag>cozy</ntag> and <ntag>comfortable</ntag> but still with an upscale touch.  40's style decor with black and white classic movies playing on a couple screens.  The patio is beautiful as well with a kind of mediterranean feel.  It's totally hidden in an office building which makes it an even better find! The food is awesome as well! If you like cheese they have a whole cheese list on the front! This place is so <ntag>yummy</ntag>! Their menu comes on a clipboard so they can change it often to what is <ntag>fresh</ntag> at the time. The calamari app is awesome with the curry dipping <ntag>sauce</ntag>! Yum! I had the <ptag>steak</ptag> before with <ptag>asparagus</ptag> and it was really good.  I've actually never had anything from there that wasn't <ntag>fantastic</ntag>.  I dont know who said the service wasn't good, because their service is <ntag>excellent</ntag>.  Always very professional and on top of things and knew their menu.  My water was never empty.  Definitely a <ntag>great</ntag> place for great food, conversation, or a first date bc the atmosphere is so comfortable! No complaints!"
