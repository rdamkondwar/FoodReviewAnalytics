"One of the best places in Montreal to get <ptag>wings</ptag>. Their 911 <ptag>wings</ptag> have a little bit if a kick to them. However,  their specials are <ntag>amazing</ntag>. 12 <ptag>wings</ptag>, 1 footlong <ptag>cheese steak</ptag>, two <ptag>sodas</ptag> and 2 orders of <ptag>fries</ptag> for $21.99! Also, they easily have the best <ptag>cheese steak</ptag> in <ntag>Montreal</ntag>.  Recommended!"
"Ordered from Buffalo Bill Wings through Justeat.com on a whim. Got a 6 smoked <ptag>meat sandwich</ptag>, 10 <ptag>wings</ptag>, and <ptag>fries</ptag> and was very very pleased. Including delivery and a tip, the total came to <ntag>less</ntag> than $23, very affordable. All I ordered was definitely too much for one person to eat, next time I'll probably just get either the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> or the <ptag>wings</ptag>, both are equally <ntag>delicious</ntag>. The service was prompt and the delivery driver, whom I spoke to on the phone and in <ntag>person</ntag>, was incredibly nice. I'll definitely order from Buffalo Bill Wings again."
"I ordered a original <ptag>cheese steak sandwich</ptag>, it was not very <ntag>good</ntag> at all almost no <ptag>cheese</ptag> I couldn't see any or taste any at all for that matter. Came with 4 wings I took the 911 <ntag>sauce</ntag>. The <ptag>wings</ptag> are deep fried witch I like but are so small hardly any <ptag>meat</ptag> on them at all. The <ptag>fries</ptag> where your substandard <ntag>frozen</ntag> <ptag>fries</ptag> not very good at all. The <ntag>sauce</ntag> had a little kick but not a original or <ntag>amazing</ntag> taste at all basicly franks red lot and viniger.The price is descent but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
