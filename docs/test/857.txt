"Skip this! It was <ntag>Gourmet</ntag> night because of the holiday(Presidents Day) $48 per person, <ptag>beer</ptag> or <ptag>wine</ptag> and additional $14.99 per person.  The <ptag>King crab</ptag> <ntag>served cold</ntag>, in fact by the time you got to your table your entire meal was cold.  The server was not the <ntag>best</ntag>, yet we had to tip prior to sitting down, so she got $18 for bringing water. 2 of them.So if you are going to spend $120 for two people and expect an actual Gourmet meal filed with <ptag>king crab</ptag>, <ptag>Kobe beef</ptag>, <ptag>salmon</ptag>.... Go elsewhere."
