"Huge portion sizes. One <ptag>sandwich</ptag> is plenty for 2 people. Kind of expensive for a deli but the food was good. Conveniently located next to <ntag>the</ntag> Cleveland clinic."
"It's really close to <ntag>my</ntag> workplace, so it gets attention from me.  Chicago Deli is very much a deli... fresh <ptag>meats</ptag> and <ptag>lettuce</ptag> and <ptag>tomatoes</ptag> go a long way.  Service is moderately <ntag>quick</ntag> and prices are middle of the road.One highlight is the Romanian.  <ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>Salami sandwich</ptag> with a slightly different <ntag>sauce</ntag>.  First place I've had this particular combo.  I've eaten it once, and I'll eat it again!"
"I ate here because I didn't have a car and I had nowhere else to go to get some food. The restaurant looked normal but the options weren't very <ntag>appealing</ntag> to me.  I was reluctant at first but I ended up getting a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and a <ptag>bowl of chili</ptag>.  It was <ntag>amazing</ntag> but it did the trick.   If I stay at <ntag>the</ntag> hotel again I'll probably eat here just for a quick bite before I got out but I'd rather travel a few miles to find something better."
