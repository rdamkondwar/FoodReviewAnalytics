"We went for the Sunday brunch. The <ntag>place</ntag> was fairly empty when we arrived at 11.30 AM. They have a solid collection of brunch items. The portions are fairly small so you dont waste food. They also specify that they will charge you for excess wastage of food. Apart from that, everything we ordered was <ntag>fresh</ntag> and <ntag>tasty</ntag>. We started with the <ptag>tom yum soup</ptag>, ordered a bunch of appetizers - crispy <ptag>tiger shrimp</ptag>, <ptag>tornado rolls</ptag>,<ptag>crab meat</ptag> in <ptag>thai red curry</ptag> followed by some entrees and a variety of sushi served in 6 pieces each. \n\nIt was pretty reasonable at $16.99 considering the quality and the variety of food. We'll probably be back when we feel in an 'All You Can Eat' place"
"Ate here on a Friday night with a friend and it was a good time. We enjoyed the $26.99 all you can eat premium tasting menu. It was probably one of the best AYCE places I have ever been to. I started off with the <ptag>mango salad</ptag> and my friend had the <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag>. Both were great. Our favorite starter was the <ptag>triple cheese dumplings</ptag> which was a <ptag>flaky crab</ptag> and <ptag>cheese filled pastry</ptag>.\n\nI had the <ptag>sashimi</ptag> which was good although the pieces were cut too thick for my liking. The presentation for each dish was always beautiful.\n\nI really like the size of the main courses which were just enough so that you could try various things. I had the lamb chop. We finished things off with green tea  and coconut ice cream.\n\nOh and we also had wine. A bottle of 2013 sauvignon blanc cost us $25, which was reasonable. \n\nOverall I would say it was a really enjoyable night with lots of great food in a nice atmosphere for the price paid. Definitely going to go back!!"
"Went for a walk with my wife downtown toronto sunday afternoon.  Its was nice to walk around without the headache of the crowds.  We stopped by Springroll's lunch on our way home.  I saw that they had pho on the menu and of course had to try it.  It was made alittle different.  They used a wider noodle and the beansprouts n basil is added to the soup already.  The <ptag>broth</ptag> though was awesome.  Anyone who has had great pho will tell you that the broth makes the dish.  \n\nService was a little slow though. Time was ticking away on the parking meter.  Made me nervous.  It was on the pricey side."
"Due to the review and recommendation of my fellow Yelper Adam B. I came to <ntag>Spring Rolls</ntag>. Actually while I was getting lost in St. Lawrence Spring Rolls found me. And since it was raining and I needed a place to regroup and let my hair dry the timing couldn't have been more perfect.\n\nAt first glance I thought to myself this place seems a bit too trendy chic for me. I like my Asian restaurants a little more down and dirty authentic. With that in mind I decided I would get just one roll and since it was a cold rainy day a bowl of soup was in order. \n\nThe Sexy <ptag>Salad Summer Roll</ptag> with its <ptag>smoked salmon</ptag>, <ptag>tiger shrimp</ptag> and <ptag>California greens</ptag> rolled up in rice paper was the obvious choice for me and would be a testament to how fresh their fish was. The <ntag>sauce</ntag> served along side had a <ntag>fiery</ntag> tastiness that only added to the sexy in this spring roll. \n\nAs for the soup I went with the <ptag>Tom Yum Goong</ptag> which is typically a favorite for me but here it fell flat. The menu description read that it contained <ptag>tiger shrimp</ptag>, <ptag>lemongrass</ptag>, <ptag>galangal</ptag>, <ptag>lime leaves</ptag>, <ptag>mushrooms</ptag>, <ptag>chili</ptag> and <ptag>lemon juice</ptag>. Yet as I dove into the soup I discovered sweet cherry tomato halves which caused the soup to have an overall light sweet taste to it not at all spicy like the little chili pepper symbol next to the menu description boasted. Disappointed but still hungry I continued to slurp it up finding a plethora of seasonings hiding out at the bottom of the bowl. I deemed the cause due to me receiving the last of the soup or the bottom of the barrel to be more specific. \n\nThere is a reason why this place is called \"Spring Rolls\" because that is exactly what should order if you come here."
