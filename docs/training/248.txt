"Very cool modern cafe that <ntag>you</ntag> wouldn't expect to find out in <ntag>the</ntag> small village of <ntag>Paoli</ntag>. The patio overlooking the river really tops it off.Solid menu for lunch - the <ptag>soup</ptag> was a <ntag>great</ntag> autumn-warmer: curry-squash. They have a few different types of <ptag>sandwiches</ptag>, which were definitely above average. Desserts were top notch, and the bottled <ptag>beer</ptag> selection entertained.What a <ntag>great</ntag> little place, just a tad more expensive than <ntag>I</ntag> would have <ntag>liked</ntag>."
