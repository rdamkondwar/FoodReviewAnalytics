IT TASTES WEIRD AND BAD. every bite of that thing was a huUGE regret. i was starving today after 3 hours of a studio class so i had to refuel with SOME <ntag>FOOD</ntag> OTHER THAN <ntag>MCDONALDS</ntag> AND MY OCCASIONAL <ptag>TIMMYS BLUEBERRY MOOFFIN</ptag>. i have been eyeing this round looking piece of <ptag>bread</ptag> looking thing for a while now so i was like okay les get it. it was $3.5 and you know i expected it to be filled with some kind of meat or something BUT NO I THINK ITS LIKE SOME KIND OF <ptag>VEGETABLE</ptag> its black and IDK but man it tastes weird... not as bad as the <ptag>gyro</ptag> but still bad LOL im sorry but this place seriously didn't do me justice (I didn't feel too well after eating it and I can't really tell if it stank or not but this dude moved away from me on the subway LOOOL)unfortunately after two bad experiences with this place i can gladly say i won't be having ANYTHING from here anymore ***i saw the dudes grabbing <ptag>fries</ptag> to eat with their hands like um... i just find that unsanitary... oh and  they took FOREVER TO ask me what i wanted like forreal there's like one customer in front of me and three of you guys LIKE GET YO BUTT OVER HERE AND TAKE MY ORDER !!! DONT STAND AROUND EATING </ptag>FRIES</ptag>?"
