"Toyo, Toyo, Toyo... where do I begin. I was <ntag>first</ntag> introduced to this place 4 years ago, for <ntag>my</ntag> friend's 18th birthday. We had an unbelievably fun time with the tempenyaki grills and a wonderful chef/performer. I came back another time for a company dinner (my suggestion, woo!) and they were able to accomodate close to 25-30 of us at 2 facing tables. We had another great performance by a chef and everyone left satisfied.I've come back several times since, in much smaller groups. Unfortunately, the chefs never perform or make a spectacle for smaller parties only the large groups, pretty disappointing. Also, the food can be pretty bland if not seasoned perfectly - which has been the case the last couple of times.It's also not really that cheap given the portions. Service is pretty decent at the tempenyaki tables - <ptag>soup</ptag>, <ptag>salad</ptag> and the meal for one price (<ptag>rice</ptag> included) for one price and the servers are usually quick to bring out this portion. Tempenyaki takes a little bit of time - so do not come in here if you're in a rush - they usually wait to fill up the whole table with small parties... which by the way, is incredibly awkward! I'm sure there are better tempenyaki places in <ntag>Montreal</ntag>, but Toyo will make do."
"I was going out to dinner with a client and wanted something good near my hotel. My brother, being a local, recommended Toyo. Although you can get <ptag>sushi</ptag> here, the main attraction is the <ptag>Teppanyaki</ptag>.As other Yelpers have mentionned, if you don't come with a large enough group to fill up the whole table, they will seat <ntag>you</ntag> with others and you'll have to wait until the whole table is full before the chef will start the show/dinner. Luckily for us, this only took about 15 minutes, in which we had enough time to sample some of their tasty sake.Our chef was absolutely hilarious! He had a sort of Bruce Lee trying to <ntag>do</ntag> a joke type of humour and was a magician with his utensils. My colleague went for the <ptag>scallops</ptag>, while I opted for the <ptag>filet mignon</ptag>. Both were very <ntag>tasty</ntag> but the chef mentioned that I should try the samurai <ptag>steak</ptag> next time, as it's his personal favourite. He let me have a little bite and it was <ntag>delicious</ntag>.Half way through the dinner, he asked us if anyone was celebrating anything special. We weren't there for anything in particular but my birthday was coming up that weekend so I told him I was turning 28. He surprised us with something spectacular (see the pic I posted!).We really had a great evening here. I highly recommend Toyo if you're in the mood for a fantastic dinner and a show."
