"<ntag>Great</ntag> Value. We vist this place several times a year as we show <ntag>horses</ntag> there. They have <ntag>very nice</ntag> rooms large clean with granite counter tops and flat screen TVs a 4 star hotel for sure. The casino is <ntag>nice</ntag> and <ntag>clean</ntag>. We have tried all the resturants and like Michaels the best <ptag>Silverado steak</ptag> house and the Oyster bar are great too.  They have a <ntag>nice</ntag> <ntag>Movie theater</ntag>and <ntag>Bowling Alley</ntag> too. I would stay at this place regardless if I was <ntag>showing</ntag> horses at the equestian center or not."
