"Went to <ntag>cook</ntag> out tonite and ordered 2 trays both with double <ptag>bacon</ptag> <ptag>burgers</ptag>. My double <ptag>bacon</ptag> <ptag>burger</ptag> had more than <ptag>bacon</ptag> and the usual toppings it <ntag>had</ntag> a huge piece of charcoal on the <ptag>burger</ptag>. I <ntag>bit</ntag> down on the <ptag>burger</ptag> and noticed something hard after spitting it out this is <ntag>what</ntag> I found ...."
"Super fast service and sweet cashiers.  Will be going there during my <ntag>lunch</ntag> break again. LOVE their <ptag>banana</ptag> <ptag>pudding</ptag> <ptag>milkshake</ptag>. They also have really <ntag>good</ntag> <ptag>burgers</ptag> and <ptag>chicken strip</ptag>.  <ptag>Fries</ptag> could be better.  But overall, great food and great experience and this cookout."
