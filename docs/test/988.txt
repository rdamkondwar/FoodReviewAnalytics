"<ntag>Great</ntag> place for playing pool in the late afternoons, and ordering <ptag>pizza</ptag>. I hope they still have <ntag>great</ntag> <ptag>pizza</ptag>. The power music starts a little early, but when the party gets going, the service is on top of everything. My straight friends were so impressed, that they said it reminded them of being on a Cruise. You never find yourself waiting to order your next </ntag>cocktail</ntag>. There are usually <ntag>attractive</ntag> men and women working, and treating everyone with <ntag>personable</ntag> service. Music is hip-hop or dance, and live entertainment is usually on the weekends. <ntag>Good</ntag> times here"
