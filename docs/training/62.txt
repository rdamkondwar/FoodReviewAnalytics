"Since my neighbor told us about <ntag>Marco's Pizza</ntag> we've tried it, loved it, and haven't eaten any other brand. Well our last order was more than we anticipated. When my daughter split two slices apart to eat one a greasy dead fly fell from between the two slices. I called Marco's spoke with a manager who stated he saw the order in the system and would credit the <ntag>Marco's</ntag> account. Well..... As we attempted to order <ptag>Pizza</ptag> tonight not only is the Credit not there they are saying it's nothing they can do about it now. Never again will I eat Marco's <ptag>Pizza</ptag>. Terrible customer service if you ask me."
"Ok <ptag>pizza</ptag> but not cooked enough for me. Had delivery last night by the pool. The <ntag>large</ntag> <ptag>veggie pizza</ptag> was <ntag>ordered</ntag> with no <ptag>olives</ptag> but somehow came loaded with very <ntag>chewy</ntag> <ptag>bacon</ptag>. The other three <ptag>pizzas</ptag> were <ntag>ok</ntag>."
