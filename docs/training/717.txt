"In my search for the <ntag>best</ntag> green chili <ptag>burro</ptag> in <ntag>Phoenix<ntag>, I always end up coming back here. Their <ptag>burro</ptag> is in my top 3 for sure. To be honest I haven't eaten much else here. It's a <ntag>comfortable</ntag> place, with a nice shaded <ntag>patio</ntag> and cheap <ptag>beer</ptag>. I like their <ptag>chips</ptag> and salsa, not the usual fair. It's a <ntag>good</ntag> place to drop in and grab a quick bite. <ptag>Margaritas</ptag> are not <ntag>impressive</ntag>, but technically you have to order those from Mateo's next door."
