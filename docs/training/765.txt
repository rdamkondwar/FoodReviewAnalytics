BUT, in my defense...it was like impulse shopping - impulse dining. Anyways. I ordered a <ptag>bloody mary</ptag>, to get my tummy prepared for the onslaught of food that it was about to receive. Also, the </ptag>artichoke dip</ptag>, <ptag>sliders</ptag> and <ptag>tacos</ptag>. Clock ticking. Excitement fading. Tummy growling. Irritation growing. Finally, the <ptag>bloody mary</ptag> arrives! Or should I say <ptag>tomato juice</ptag>. No celery <ntag>salt</ntag>, <ntag>hot sauce</ntag>, <ntag>worcestershire sauce</ntag>, ANYTHING. Except for a whole fucking celery tree that was engulfing the glass. Boo hiss. The rest I shall summarize: Artichoke dip = large jar of mayo. Again no flavor. <ptag>Tacos</ptag> = soaked in sauce (aka mayo)...couldn't taste much besides that. <ptag>Sliders</ptag> = ok. Just ok. <ptag>Meat</ptag> reminded me of what I imagine wet dog food to taste like. So, why the two stars you ask? Well..I added one star for the <ntag>cheap</ntag> drink prices during happy hour (stick to <ptag>beer</ptag>, maybe). Now I shall find my giraffe and ride off in the sunset, in search of some </ntag>good</ntag>food."
