"Wow, where is my seat, found it. Server was cute, he thought, NOT.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about or yelp about. <ptag>California grill cheese</ptag> was okay. I had a <ptag>roast beef</ptag>, <ptag>pastrami turkey sandwich</ptag>, lots of <ptag>meat</ptag> shoved in <ptag>bread</ptag> with ranch dressing, why ranch? It was <ntag>late</ntag> and the restaurant was trashed, dirty tables, floors, and restroom."

"Food was mediocre, service was mediocre, overall dining experience was mediocre, luckily we were in <ntag>good</ntag> company so it wasn't an absolute disaster. However, I would never come back to <ntag>this</ntag> place as there are places MUCH better than this within walking distance.We came as a party of 8 equipped with 5 Free Appetizer coupons. We were seated and the first thing we noticed was <ntag>the</ntag> GIGANTIC menu selection. There was a lot of things to <ntag>choose</ntag> from and a lot of us had to take some time to read all of it to decide what to eat. After a few minutes our server came without introducing himself, not even giving us a smile and asked if we wanted any drinks. We just said we wanted water for now and he simply left without responding. After a while he came back, again not smiling or even appearing to be happy, and we ordered 5 appetizers. 2 <ptag>Nachos with meat sauce</ptag>, 2 <ptag>PEI Mussels</ptag> and 1 <ptag>Vegetable Quesadilla</ptag>. <ptag>Nachos with Meat Sauce</ptag> - These came in <ntag>great</ntag> portions smothered in <ptag>cheese</ptag>, <ptag>jalepenos</ptag> and meat sauce. They were gigantic and we could not finish them all even as a party of 8.s
