"So against my better judgement, I rejected the many bad reviews this place received, and went to take a go at it myself.\n\nAs you can probably tell already, I genuinely wished I hadn't. I'm sitting here - well, laying now, feeling sluggish and greasy and sick to my stomach after just one meal here. Here's my take on it.\n\nI read that one cockroach review. Got me freaked out, not gonna lie, but <ntag>man</ntag> - <ptag>noodles</ptag> were cheap. I'm cheap. Match made. Didn't care if there were bugs in the floor, so long as my food was good and cheap, all was well with the world. But no. You take one sip of your soup, there's a fly in your noodles. You eat your noodles, there's a suspicious looking insect now in your tea. You drink the tea, eat the noodles, and sip the soup - keeping an eye on everything - now there's a spider crawling up your goddamn leg. This place can't be stopped. I swear I was almost impressed.\n\nThe <ptag>pad thai</ptag> was store-bought noodles slathered in sesame oil and peanut sauce.  I would know because I made the same thing a week ago. College kid troubles.\n\n<ptag>Wonton soup</ptag> was nice, until I came upon the 4-5 large lumps of \"dumplings\" that tasted like chewed and spit out liver (I was told later on it was chicken).\n\nOnly thing I would really suggest here are the shrimp rolls, in which they give you 4-5 thin little coconut-shrimp-like rolls of heaven.\n\nThat got one star, along with the fast service, so this place is a genuine \"probably never again.\" But hey! You might find a new kind of bug you haven't seen before."
