"I have to admit this is my first time having a <ptag>Pintos</ptag>. I wasn't sure what expect as I really didn't look into the reviews. You could say I went in blindly, true but the OH said it was ok, so maybe slightly true. \n\nAnyways lets get to the food. I choose the <ptag>tacos</ptag> - one with <ptag>pork</ptag> and two with <ptag>chicken</ptag>. <ptag>Guacamole</ptag> was extra but who can't have <ptag>guacamole</ptag>? Seriously I love the stuff. I prefer mine a little chunkier rather than too smooth as it just adds more texture to the overall dish.\n\nBoth <ptag>chicken</ptag> and <ptag>pork tacos</ptag> were delicious and for value it was pretty decent.\n\nThe other half had a <ptag>chicken,</ptag> <ptag>burrito</ptag> and seemed happy with it.\n\nWe both had a non-alcoholic <ptag>ginger beer</ptag> for drink. \n\nAll in it was under \u00a320 for a quick dinner. Service was quick but nothing really outstanding. \n\nJust be careful if you go to the toilets as you walk through the door there are stairs to your right."
