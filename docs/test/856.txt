"Wandered into <ntag>Frankie's</ntag> around midnight on a Friday night. Very eclectic mix of clientele - lots of drunk underaged Asians (I'm sure this was random), a kooky local who was camped out at the back playing solitaire and a few normal looking types ordering drinks at the bar and eating late night <ptag>burgers</ptag>.My date ordered a <ptag>Greek burger</ptag>with <ptag>sweet potato fries</ptag>. <ptag>Fries</ptag> were definitely <ntag>tasty</ntag> but I didn't try the <ptag>burger</ptag>. Although it seemed everyone around (drunk people) were really enjoying their <ptag>burgers</ptag>.<ntag>Friendly</ntag> waitress and prices were <ntag>decent</ntag>. <ntag>Good</ntag> spot to stop for a quick bite!"
