"After moving up to <ntag>Pittsburgh</ntag>, I was <ntag>worried</ntag> I wasn't going to <ntag>find</ntag> any good food at all.  Especially to <ntag>satisfy</ntag> my newly acquired taste for Mediterranean food.  Luckily enough Istanbul Grille opened up right across the street from me, and I have been eating there at <ntag>least</ntag> twice a week for the past 8months, minus the time I go home for <ntag>break</ntag>. The food is amazing, everything is fresh, even down to the <ptag>yogurt</ptag> used in the <ntag>sauces</ntag> and certain dishes.  The <ptag>baklava</ptag> is the best I have ever had, my family tells me bring home at least 2 dozen pieces when I come home to visit.   The <ptag>gyro</ptag> is amazing! It is not the frozen blend of <ptag>lamb</ptag> that you see most college restaurants selling!  This is the actual <ptag>meat</ptag> on the spit style <ptag>gyro</ptag>.  My favorite dish is the <ptag>Kofte Plate</ptag>."
"the marinated <ptag>baby lamb</ptag> is <ntag>insane</ntag>. The baba is excellent (nice smoke flavor), and portions overall are appropriate.  They serve a <ntag>fluffy</ntag> <ptag>warm pita</ptag> with hummus/baba, <ptag>kabob sandwiches</ptag>, etc. that is much better than the all too often <ntag>dried</ntag> out Pitaland brand <ptag>pita</ptag> common in Pittsburgh middle-eastern restaurants (pitaland is ok, but the fact that this place took the time to find a nice alternative is a plus).  Owner really tries hard to please which is appreciated but he can be a bit pushy (he means well though).  Honestly this place kills Alladin's Eatery. 4 stars is a lot for <ntag>me</ntag>."
