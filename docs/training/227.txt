"Compared to the Grum's in <ntag>Coventry</ntag>, this place doesn't come close.  The inside feels like you are <ntag>walking</ntag> into what I would imagine a Russian bakery would feel like during the cold war.  Sparse and lacking in imagination.  The people working there reflect the decor to you as well- they are about the most unhappy people I think I have ever met.  That being said, the subs are still pretty <ntag>good</ntag>, but I do think that the Grum's in Coventry taste better.  Not sure why- probably the same ingredients, maybe it is just how they are put together or something?  This place is great if you are in the area, need a quick <ptag>sandwich</ptag> (because there is never a line here) and need to keep moving.  Keep in <ntag>mind</ntag> that their large sub is about 2 feet long.  I have put a couple down myself, but don't need to <ntag>eat</ntag> the rest of the day.  The Turkey Ridge is <ntag>one</ntag> of the best subs, but my buddy always gets the hot subs which he swears by."
