"Jimmy the Greek is located at the food court in <ntag>Scarborough</ntag> Town Centre.Service is <ntag>quick</ntag>. Decided to try the <ptag>Chicken Souvlaki Dinner</ptag> which comes with <ptag>Greek Salad</ptag>, <ptag>Rice</ptag> and <ptag>Roasted Potatoes</ptag>. Total came to <ntag>about</ntag> $8. Unfortunately, <ptag>pita bread</ptag> does not come with the <ptag>Souvlaki Dinner</ptag>. It's $0.75 extra.The dressing for the <ptag>salad </ptag> was slightly too <ntag>watery</ntag>. The <ptag>chicken</ptag> had a nice consistency but could have used more seasoning. It was <ntag>a</ntag> bit <ntag>lacking</ntag> in flavor. The <ptag>potatoes</ptag> were tender but also lacking in flavor. Everything tasted quite <ntag>fresh</ntag>. Nice portion and filling. A good option to have in <ntag>a</ntag> food court."
