"Hello friends, Two words.. Monday & Tuesday. Half off boneless wings. I love thier <ptag>lemon pepper</ptag> (a la Rick Ross). You can call in you order for pick up, order at the front for take out or dine in. I'm usually picking up 20 wings (real wings or boneless) and a order of fries before I go I work. \n\nFries?? Did somebody say Fries? Yes, yes I did. If you like fresh cut fries. This is the place. If you like that burger joint that givess you wayyyyyy to many. These are in the same lane. GOOD!!! They have the malt vinegar to go along with it. Ummmmm It's in a strip mall (ohhh nooooo) tucked away in the corner. They're open til 12:00AM. I'm not sure about this location but the one in Pineville used to sell beer as well. Today is Monday which means....... See my 1st sentence.\n\nGo enjoy! \nTTFN"
"This Wing Stop really gets it right.  The <ptag>wings</ptag> and <ptag>tenders</ptag> are just perfect.  I give credit to the staff.  I have been to other locations in Texas and Illinois, and they were not even close to mastering the ingredients.  The baked beans are interesting, kind of a beer taste to the sauce.  The tenders are crispy but not way too crunchy.  The wings are traditional or boneless.  The rolls are pretty delicious.  Interesting also is the wide selection of IBC products in the cooler, if you like that more than Coke or tea.  Wingstop does have an odd way of using paper towels in place of napkins, that is a company quirk, so pack your own otherwise."
