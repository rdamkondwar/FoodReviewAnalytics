"The bottom line with this place: delicious beers at reasonable prices.  We stopped by here after climbing Mount Royal and had ourselves a good time.  I highly recommend this location for the flavor of their beers, the speed of their service, and their breezy location with outdoor seating.  Come here for a <ptag>beer</ptag> and enjoy!"
"Great <ptag>beer</ptag>, wide variety of styles, all well done. Had a great spicy <ptag>hot dog</ptag> as well. Nice <ntag>casual place</ntag>"
"Came here with a few friends as part of the Montreal craft beer tour. The <ntag>outdoor seating</ntag> is nice in the summer, especially when we were there back in August as it was 70 degrees and sunny.  This place has a wide selection of craft beer and the chocolate that was served with it was delicious. Seriously one of the best craft beer bars in Montreal. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area."
"I've been going to this place regularly for the last two years, and I'm happy to have such nice place next to my home. The beer selection is great considering that they serve only their own beer. Whatever your taste in beer, there is always two or three on tap that you'll enjoy. So every body in your gang will be happy.\nThe <ntag>people</ntag> who work in Benelux are professional and know the <ptag>beer</ptag>. The <ntag>atmosphere</ntag> is very friendly but they respect your privacy perfectly.\nDon't forget to taste their <ptag>roasted almonds</ptag>!"
"After wandering around Montreal for a few days looking for good beer and finding the Canadian equvalent of \"Bud, Bud Light, Coors, Coors Light, Miller, Miller Lite\", this place was a very welcome oasis.\n\nThe Cuda IPA was delicious, they stayed open late, and the <ntag>wait staff</ntag> was welcoming and <ntag>informed</ntag>."
"This place seems to be a mainstay for UQAM students for happy hours after work. I stopped in with the other scientists I was working with and we got a nice big booth in the corner. The beer list is good and cheap for Montreal, but I wasn't sold on the interior. It was just a beat down little bar that seems to be to go-to place for no reason other than it's close. However, the <ntag>bar</ntag> has a bunch of tables outside in the front, which I'm sure would be a great <ntag>venue<ptag></ntag> during the summer."
"Every time I go back to Montreal, I have to make a trip to Benelux. Geoffrey is a rockstar, and is usually plastered by the time I get there.\n\nThe </ptag>beer is all great - special kudos to Cuda, but everything on the menu is fantastic. I don't think I've ever had a beer I didn't like. The Euro Dogs are pretty good, and make for great <ntag>drunk food</ntag>.\n\nGo in the back, sit in the vault, and enjoy one of the best <ptag>beer</ptag> bars in Montreal."
