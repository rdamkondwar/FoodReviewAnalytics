Come next year, that's going to change.  There's almost nothing I would change about this event.  I just wish it would come around more than once a year.  Here's the lowdown.\n\nFood City (a grocery store subsidiary of Basha's) puts on their annual Tamale Festival during the holidays every year in Downtown Phoenix.  This year the event was held just outside City Hall along Washington Street from 1st Avenue to 3rd Avenue.  Admission is free and almost all of the vendors will hound you with free samples to try and lure you into buying one or more of their own tamale recipes.  In addition to the dozens of tamale vendors to choose from, there are vendors selling other foods including <ptag>tacos</ptag>, <ptag>burritos</ptag>, <ptag>papusas</ptag>, <ptag>snow cones</ptag>, <ptag>fry bread</ptag>, and the <ntag>list</ntag> goes on.  There was also live music and dance performances at the main stage near the west entrance.  The event takes place on <ntag>Saturday</ntag> and <ntag>Sunday</ntag> typically during the second weekend of December.  I came on Sunday expecting a light crowd.  To my amazement, it was absolutely packed with people from all backgrounds and walks of life.  Despite that, moving through the crowd was fairly easy as folks mostly kept the center of the road open for walking by.  That said, they might want to spread out the tamale vendors a little bit more throughout the road rather than packing most of them into one half of the festival grounds.  Anyways, let's get to what you really need to know.\n\nThe tamale of course is as ubiquitously linked with Christmas in Arizona as lights on the Christmas tree.  My family has maintained a tradition of having tamales at Christmas for generations.  So it should come as no surprise that the tamale vendors here were selling tamales both individually as well as by the dozen.  And there were plenty of folks here buying them in bulk.  I just came for individual ones, and man were they good.  No way I could've sampled them all, but I did manage to get my hands on a <ptag>red chili pork tamale</ptag>, a <ptag>green chili chicken tamale</ptag>, a <ptag>sweet corn tamale</ptag>, and even a <ptag>blackberry dessert tamale</ptag>.  All of them were awesome (though for me the green chili chicken is pretty hard to beat).  Besides Food City, a lot of the vendors here were local Catholic churches, many of which are predominantly Latino.  There were also a few local restaurants mixed in.  In addition to four tamales, I snuck in a pupusa (cause why wouldn't you) and a horchata (because well, yes).  The best part?  Each and every item I just mentioned here was just $2 each.  So yes, 4 tamales, a pupusa and a horchata.  $12.  An absolute home run in terms of value.  No wonder this place was jam packed.\n\nSo next time this event pops up, do yourself a favor and grab a wad of dollar bills (shouldn't need more than $20 worth), get down to Phoenix City Hall, and bring your appetite.  Or bring more cash and load up on tamales by the dozen.  Or if you want to go with a specific vendor for Christmas tamales closer to Christmas Eve, choose the vendor you like the best and take down their info so you can order some then.  Truly one of the best food events I've been to here in town.  Excellent food, cheap prices, great variety, and a reminder of what makes the valley a great place to live.  People from all cultures and walks of life converging together for a dish that is as much apart of life in the valley as a sun-drenched day."
