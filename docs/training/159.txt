"Bobby is back!  A different name but the same outstanding food!  The service and food is <ntag>great</ntag>.  When you walk in <ntag>you</ntag> get the aroma of fresh <ptag>garlic</ptag> & Italian Food cooking and a huge greeting from Bobby!    I just don't know what to <ntag>order</ntag> when I'm there because everything is so <ntag>delicious</ntag>.  The <ptag>chicken parm</ptag> is one of my all time favorites.  Love the <ptag>pasta</ptag> & <ptag>salads</ptag> too!  Love, love, love this place!!!!!  PS try the <ptag>garlic knots</ptag>."
"I tried this place after reading such rave reviews and was with expectations of finding a nice little hole in the wall Italian <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and <ptag>pasta</ptag> shop. Unfortunately I was very <ntag>disappointed</ntag> to find very generic and canned flavors in <ntag>sauce</ntag>, portions to price ratio also a disappointment. I ordered a <ptag>chicken parm</ptag> sub and what I hit was a toasted nun with a scant amount of <ptag>chicken</ptag>, melted <ptag>cheese</ptag>, and generic <ptag>marinara</ptag> that I have eaten in several places. My wife orders the <ptag>cheese ravioli</ptag> with <ptag>meatball</ptag> and was equally disappointed. The <ptag>ravioli</ptag> tasted like generic Costco <ptag>pasta</ptag>, the <ptag>meatball</ptag> had no spices to flavor the <ptag>meat</ptag>, and the sauce was the same generic commercial stuff as well. I believe the owner took our order and he was <ntag>nice</ntag> and accommodating. The problem is <ntag>that</ntag> a smiling face does not make up for mediocre food. Overall just a let down as I had anticipated more authentic flavors. By the way, the two portions mentioned and a soda for $19. Too much for a lunch style place considering small quantities and lack of authenticity. Not a repeat in my opinion."
"A wonderful new option for lunch in Scottsdale!I stopped in <ntag>on</ntag> their second day open and my experience was <ntag>flawless</ntag>. It was a Thursday and the special was Italian <ptag>Beef</ptag> with Au Jus. I had to try it. I ordered the half size for ($4.25) and it was plenty.It arrived piping hot with melted mozzarella on really <ntag>great</ntag> Italian <ptag>bread</ptag>. The Jus was the best I've had outside of my ma's kitchen and the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was <ntag>amazing</ntag>. The <ptag>beef</ptag> was so <ntag>tender</ntag> with no bits of fat.The restaurant is small and clean. The owners are the real deal. They were making sure everything was just right. I am so <ntag>excited</ntag> to have this wonderful option for lunch with a great price point ($4.25 - $9.95) and amazing food. They have daily specials that are <ntag>awesome</ntag>."
