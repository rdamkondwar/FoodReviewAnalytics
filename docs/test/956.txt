"I don't think there's anywhere else like this place, in Edinburgh. It's an absolute <ntag>gem</ntag>, packed with shiny <ntag>delights</ntag>. <ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>soup</ptag> and <ntag>excellent</ntag> </ntag>savoury</ntag> treats were what took my fancy, but I can't wait to go back and test out more of their repertoire. Oh, and it's ridiculously good value, too.Overall, we said: I was thoroughly delighted with the <ntag>Sicilian Pastry Shop</ntag>. If it were a bit nearer to my place of business, there would be an extreme likelihood of me visiting it on a dangerously frequent basis. As it is, there are still enough places on the way to it, to distract me. For sure, you should visit it very soon, as the quality on offer is really <ntag>impressive</ntag>. Savoury and <ntag>sweet</ntag> lovers alike will be in for a genuine treat."
