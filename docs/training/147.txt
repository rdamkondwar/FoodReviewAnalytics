"The Winchester holds unique events and activities on different nights and my review is <ntag>for</ntag> the Monday improv event and for a nerd games night that I attended. The Winchester is <ntag>a</ntag> nice venue for small events and they have a small stage upfront. On these event nights the Winchester offers free food! The free food is usually <ptag>pasta</ptag>, stir-fry, some other carbs, <ptag>salad</ptag> and a sweet dessert.  Free food is always <ntag>good</ntag>, but I'd recommend filling up elsewhere. The bar is standard and the venue is <ntag>quite</ntag> dark and dingy. When I first went up the stairs the first time, I admit that I was scared. However, it is the people that make this a nice bar. The staff have been very tolerant, regardless of the event being held. I would definitely go back for more improv! The Monday night amateur shows are actually quite <ntag>amusing</ntag> to say the least."
"Went here as part of Cabbagetown festival. It was our first stop at <ntag>7pm</ntag>. Got some <ptag>beer</ptag> and waited more than one hour for sampling their food. Didn't they expect customers? Finally when the food arrived, it was <ntag>unseasoned</ntag>, not even a bit of salt, plus the bite size <ptag>chicken snitzel</ptag> seemed fried in old oil. They said it will take more time to bring the <ptag>chicken wings</ptag>....we left! And we weren't alone! Lot of unhappy customers around us!"
