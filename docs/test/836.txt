"If i hadnt had a personal recommendation we probably wouldnt have gone here for lunch today. Both the website and door signage are <ntag>misleading</ntag> and contradictory; confusing. But we were so <ntag>glad</ntag> our curiousity prevailed. I had the <ptag>Eggplant Sandwich</ptag>. My husband had the Grilled <ptag>Vegetable Wrap</ptag>. Two of our sons had the <ptag>Ceasar Chicken Wrap</ptag> and one had the <ptag>Lobster Roll</ptag>. Everyone loved it all! <ntag>Great</ntag> place to go for a <ntag>quick</ntag> bite and nice view. Loved the music too and staff was <ntag>attentive</ntag>. I would give 5 stars except for the unwelcoming sign at entrance and <ntag>awkward</ntag> greeting by staff. Also one dish was <ntag>awful</ntag>. My husband and I ordered a <ptag>vegetable pot pie</ptag> to share and the aroma was as <ntag>poor</ntag> as the taste."
