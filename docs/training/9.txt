"Some things in life are worth the expense.  \n\nThis review is for the Signature Grand Canyon tour.  Along the hour-long flight up to the Canyon, the pilot pointed out scenic points of interest including cattle ranches north of Phoenix, Montezuma 's Well, Sedona, Mt. Humphrey's, the Painted Desert and of course both the north and south rim of the Grand Canyon.  The flight over just the Canyon part was about 1/2 hour.  \n\nAfter landing at the Tusayan Airport, our group took a quick bathroom break and transferred to the Pink Jeep tour. An excellent balance of info, photo ops at unique visitas off the map and time to shop at Hopi House / El Tovar was provided. The box <ptag>sandwich</ptag> lunch was tasty - believe the vegetarians were happy too.\n\nIt is said that you never see the Grand Canyon the same way twice (due to time of year, time of day lighting differences and seasonal differences).  Seeing the Grand Cayon from the air is a must!"
