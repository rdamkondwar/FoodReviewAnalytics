"This was my go-to place before I moved out the the neighbourhood and had a child.  My husband and I were here probably far more often than we should have been - now it's a <ntag>rare</ntag> treat.  The atmosphere is great, it's small and cozy.  Great list of <ptag>beer</ptag> and the STAFF are <ntag>amazing</ntag>.  So <ntag>friendly</ntag> and </ntag>unpretentious</ntag>, unlike a lot of the other bars along the Assington strip.   Oh, also best <ptag>nachos</ptag> in Toronto!  The food here is REALLY <ntag>good</ntag> - an unexpected surprise.  One warning, and it's totally not the fault of the bar - it CAN get a tad douchey on a <ntag>Friday</ntag> or <ntag>Saturday</ntag> night."
