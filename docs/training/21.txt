"Not every NYF is made the same...as I learned grabbing a quick <ptag>poutine</ptag> today. <ntag>I</ntag> didn't have <ntag>enough</ntag> time in my lunch hour to <ntag>get</ntag> to Craft <ptag>Burger</ptag> and back or I would've satisfied my poutine crave <ntag>there</ntag>. I thought a quick substitute would be fine but the <ptag>poutine</ptag> was not <ntag>good</ntag>. My stomach will attack me later for the choice I made. Also, staff were talking through <ntag>my</ntag> whole transaction. The cashier put my receipt on the counter in front of me and walked off. Erm, hello? <ntag>You</ntag> could've just handed it to me!"
