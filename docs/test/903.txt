The guy who answered the phone says all pizzas are out it should be here. No better explanation. No pizza.\nFirst and only attempt to try ur pizza."
"Spent over $70 on 2 large pizzas, 2 cans of pop and 2 dipping sauces plus delivery.  The pizza was some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  Comparable to a Dr. Oetker made by a 5 year old.  One was burnt on the under side and the other had a soggy underside that the cheese could not grip it, resulting in some splats.  Toppings such as sun dried tomatoes were not-so-sun-dried, they went a little nuts with oregano and overall were a bit dull.  Delivery took roughly an hour (we live down the road by 5 minutes).  On the other hand, the walk in slices are absolutely fantastic, so what's the disconnect here?  I was justifying the price tag based on those walk in slices- which is not what I got.  It's sort of like ordering in from an Italian place and then they bring you chef boyardee.  Not going to order in from this spot again, a total waste."
"Tried the \"Gianni Ola\" and the \"Mafioso\", both were absolutely delicious! You could tell how fresh the pizza dough and ingredients are! A little pricy, but definitely worth it!"
"Great <ptag>pizza</ptag>.  Very generous with toppings.  Only complaint is that there wasn't enough sauce!!  I don't like too much sauce, but it was a bit dry,  do next time I'll ask for more!  \n\nOtherwise outstanding pizza,  great <ntag>selection</ntag> of toppings too!!"
"Our office often orders pizza from here, and its always consistently great, and much better than the standard fare of the big chains.\n\nI was here as a walk-in as Mitzie's next door was closed for the week.\n\nI had the whole wheat meat pizza, and a 600 ml bottle of soda for $7.  The portion size here is huge.  It was about a quarter of a pizza worth of huge.  My son would have been in pizza heaven.  Back to the pizza.  <ntag>Great crust</ntag> - thick and perfect, not too soft and not crunchy hard.  It held well in my hand.  The toppings and cheese were generously applied.\n\nI walked out a happy customer, and asking myself, why haven't I been here before after a year of working in the area."
"given the option of Pizza Pizza or this place down the street, this place wins on crust alone if looking for a lunchtime slice. \n\n$4.19 for a slice after tax if bought on its own."
