"Came here with a group of friends for post-dinner drinks - some wanted <ptag>smoothies</ptag> and apparently they are <ntag>pretty good</ntag> here. I on the other hand, had a blonde <ptag>beer</ptag> which was OK but while they are <ntag>neighbours</ntag> to <ntag>Le Saint Bock</ntag>, the <ptag>beer</ptag> <ntag>served</ntag> here is a bit more expensive and not as crafty.  We also got a <ptag>brownie</ptag> which was <ntag>served cold</ntag> and <ntag>very hard</ntag>. It was tasty, but a bit of a let down. I would advice that they come up with a different name for it. Calling that a <ptag>brownie</ptag> does <ptag>brownies</ptag> a disservice. Otherwise the ambiance was cool, the server was <ntag>nice</ntag>, and it was <ntag>very pleasant</ntag> to carry on a conversation here, probably better than a noisy bar!"
