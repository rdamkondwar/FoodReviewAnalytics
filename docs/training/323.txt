"I <ntag>really</ntag> did not like this resturant. I went in the summer and they did not have an A/C. Most of their food is <ntag>spicy</ntag> so you will sweat like a <ntag>pig</ntag>. The food was not tasty at all. I have been to a lot of chinese resturants and this one is certanliy the <ntag>worst</ntag>. The soup smelled like a <ptag>raw chicken</ptag> which was  so <ntag>discusting</ntag>. Sorry but thisbis the truth."
