They haven't a clue how to butcher and I've had enough which made me finally go to <ntag>Giovanni's</ntag>. I should have done it a long, long time ago. I just assumed a butcher would be more <ntag>expensive</ntag> than a grocery store. Well first off what you're getting at <ntag>Giovanni's Meats & Deli</ntag> is such a <ntag>supreme</ntag> product compared to what Giant Eagle is passing off as <ptag>meat</ptag> in their <ptag>meat</ptag> department. Contrary to their commercials they don't care about the customer (big surprise there). Giovanni's on the other hand the moment you walk in you know you're home. Plus the <ptag>pork chops</ptag> I bought were actually less expensive than Giant Eagle's and looked like <ptag>pork chops</ptag> and didn't have a big bone right smack dab in the center of the chop. The rib eye <ptag>steaks</ptag> were flawless and so delicious. In fact they were so good I got up from the table and found myself writing this review. Thank you <ntag>Giovanni's Meats & Deli</ntag> for focusing on quality <ptag>meat</ptag> and exemplary customer care. I felt like I had gone back in time when being a customer actually meant something. It also didn't hurt that the young woman who helped me was <ntag>super</ntag> <ntag>nice</ntag> and <ntag>super</ntag> <ntag>cute</ntag>."
