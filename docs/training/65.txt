"Yuck I have avoided this <ntag>Subway</ntag> like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  I literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> stink. When I say <ntag>gross</ntag> I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a <ntag>good</ntag> <ptag>sandwich</ptag> nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a <ntag>wreck</ntag>. As some one who eats at <ntag>Subway</ntag> 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion, avoid this <ntag>subway</ntag>."
