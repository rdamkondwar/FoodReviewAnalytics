"I tend to like einsteins a lot though this was my first time to this location which seemed to <ntag>be</ntag> ran entirely different. I ordered the veggie <ptag>sandwich</ptag> with hummus 6.99 and added <ptag>turkey</ptag> slices $2.50. My friend ordered the <ptag>asparagus</ptag>, <ptag>mushroom</ptag> and <ptag>egg white bagel</ptag> 4.99. Setup was weird for ordering we had to pretty much back track after ordering to another station to pay our order. Staff did not seem happy to work here.. Also seems unprofessional. We were instructed that our food would arrive to our table so we took a seat. It was <ntag>mediocre</ntag> up u too this point..... When the order arrived we were told we may grab our <ptag>chips</ptag> from the chip station since our <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> came with <ptag>chips</ptag>. The employee directed us to the chip station. We grabbed <ptag>chips</ptag> and then returned to our table to <ntag>eat</ntag>. At which point I realized the extra $3.00 I paid to add <ptag>turkey</ptag> on my <ptag>sandwich</ptag> (which is outrageous) wasn't added to the <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. I walked up to have the fix the order. I waited while other customers were helped before me. Hmmm.. Instead of remaking the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> he took the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> from my hands and put two slices of <ptag>turkey</ptag> on it (for $3.00) um okay. Upon returning to my table a secondary employee was confronting my friend because apparently her <ptag>sandwich</ptag> did not come with <ptag>chips</ptag>. How rude to speak so loudly where other customers were looking. As if we could care less about the $1.00 chips. Just a reminder we were instructed to grab <ptag>chips</ptag>... Unknown to us that <ntag>her</ntag> meal didn't come with them. We paid for the <ptag>chips</ptag> since she opened them already. We will not be coming back here. Get your $h1t together!!!!!!!"
"My coworker raved about this place so we headed over here for a quick lunch.  It took forever to get our food and when we got back to the office with it, almost everyone's order was wrong. I ordered a <ptag>turkey</ptag> <ptag>sandwich</ptag> on an <ptag>asiago bagel</ptag> - it was alright.  The <ptag>bagel</ptag> was <ntag>greasy</ntag> and the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> wasn't anything to <ntag>write</ntag> home about. The <ptag>potato salad</ptag> was the highlight of the meal and even then, I wasn't impressed.  Yes, lunch was <ntag>cheap</ntag> but you get what you pay for!"
"The staff at this location is absolutely <ntag>amazing</ntag>! I was greeted the moment I walked in. I am one of those customers with special requests and they did a great job at accommodating me. By that I mean I wanted an item on the menu modified. I got the <ptag>chicken</ptag> country <ptag>salad</ptag> <ptag>sandwich</ptag> but asked to have it made panini style. I think I made a great choice as I absolutely loved every detail about it. The manager there is super friendly and so was the cashier. I got there around closing time and they were very polite to <ntag>inform</ntag> me that they would be closing soon and didn't rush me out. I will be coming back here for sure!"
"I'm really not a huge fan of this location. As far as <ptag>bagels</ptag> go, they are really good- I've never had one that tasted stale. But the service here could definitely use some work. The staff seems to get incredibly flustered whenever there's a rush. I came in <ntag>around</ntag> 10:30am and ordered a <ptag>ham & swiss sandwich</ptag> on an artisan <ptag>bagel</ptag>- come to find out 15 MINS LATER that they ran out of artisan. So, I order it plain and come to find out again that they are out of <ptag>ham</ptag>. Upon learning this, I ordered a new <ptag>sandwich</ptag> all together- which the staff then proceeded to forget about. To compensate, they refunded my money & threw in 2 free <ptag>pastries</ptag> with my order. The thought was <ntag>appreciated</ntag>, but I unfortunately can only bring myself to give 3 stars after that."
