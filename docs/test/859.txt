"I have so many <ntag>good</ntag> memories of Firehouse. Keep in mind that many of these memories are from a few years ago, but here they are:- <ntag>Fantastic</ntag> food. Both lunch on the weekends and some small dishes around happy hour.- A terrific salsa night. Sadly, I'm not sure if it's the same anymore.- A <ntag>great</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> selection, and a staff that actually knows their <ptag>beer</ptag>. How many lounge/clubs carry more than a few light <ptag>beers</ptag> and <ptag>Heineken</ptag>? Not this one. One of my favorites was <ptag>Old Leg Humper</ptag>, which they had on tap.- <ntag>Good</ntag> music, and a <ntag>diverse</ntag> crowd. (Hope this is still the same!)"
