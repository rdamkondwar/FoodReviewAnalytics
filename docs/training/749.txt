"Food is <ntag>insanely</ntag> <ntag>good</ntag>.  <ntag>Fresh</ntag> <ptag>meats</ptag> and very, very tasty.  When you order a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> (i recommend the godfather I or II), the owner goes to the fridge and begins slicing cuts for your <ptag>sub</ptag>.  Doesn't get much fresher than that.  They have a few tables, but I've never eaten there so I cannot comment on the service but they are <ntag>always</ntag> friendly when I order take out.  In addition to a plethora of <ptag>sandwich</ptag> options there are italian dishes as well.  I've had the <ptag>lasagna</ptag> which was a <ntag>large</ntag>, flavorful portion.  Desserts are <ntag>great</ntag> too.  Try a <ptag>Cannoli</ptag>."
