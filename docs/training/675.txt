"I've been a <ntag>Golden Mountain</ntag> customer for well over 30 years. I grew up in <ntag>Richmond Hts</ntag>, and this was just around the corner from where I lived.  I moved out of state and when I returned, moved into <ntag>Willowick</ntag>.  There are at least 3 Chinese restaurants that are less then a 5 minute drive from me.  Having tried them all, I will go out of my way to go to Golden Mountain. Hands down the <ntag>best</ntag> food in Lake County. The <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag> is amazing, and the <ptag>Moo Goo Gi Pan</ptag> is outta this world. <ptag>Pork fried rice</ptag> blows the doors off!! The food is always <ntag>fresh</ntag>, the produce is <ntag>incredible</ntag> and the portions are <ntag>wonderful</ntag>.  This is my go to place, every time!"
