Better than Los Betos, Filibertos, Nicos- you get my drift! <ptag>Steak burrito</ptag> - quality meat, not filled with crap meat. Nachos are amazing, meat, real cheese fresh tomatoes. Fresh ingredients. Shrimp al Diablo .... the best. Again I am stressing the quality of the meat, fresh ingredients - surpassed the other places listed. the quality is amazing and the flavor the best."
"Pretty good <ntag> Mexican food</ntag>. I would recommend the burrito called "el panzone". It had steak, shrimp and chicken..very good."
