"Seriously a <ntag>really</ntag> <ntag>cool</ntag> spot but the food was <ntag>quite</ntag> <ntag>awful</ntag>. The waitress said a new chef was just hired who changed a lot of the favorite dishes on the menu. I <ntag>ordered</ntag> a <ptag>chicken chowder soup</ptag> which actually wasn't too bad- very <ntag>creamy</ntag> but I like that. The portobello <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was <ntag>almost</ntag> <ntag>inedible</ntag> due to the amount of salt or vinegar in the <ntag>sauce</ntag>. The drinks were sub par and <ptag>beers</ptag> listed on tap weren't even available."
