"I <ntag>love</ntag> eating here but this time I ordered for take out. Food was ready in 15mins but everything was just so<ntag> wrong</ntag>. The <ptag>burger</ptag> I ordered was <ntag>really plain</ntag>, no mayo and came with onions which we did not want. The <ptag>chilaquiles</ptag> I ordered were okay just had to take the <ptag>eggs</ptag> off since they were <ntag>extremely</ntag> runny. Totally killed my appetite. The pot of <ptag>bread</ptag> was <ntag>yummy</ntag> as usual. Next time I'll eat there instead."
