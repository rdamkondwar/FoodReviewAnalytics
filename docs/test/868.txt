"This place has a <ntag>great</ntag> outside eating area that over looks the vineyard and garden plots. The service was <ntag>good</ntag>. We really enjoyed our dinner the <ptag>steak</ptag> was <ntag>cooked</ntag> perfectly and the <ptag>cocktails</ptag> were <ntag>amazing</ntag>!"
"Went there on a Sunday for lunch. Parking is a <ntag>headache</ntag>. Their food is <ntag>good</ntag> but the forty minutes wait is not. The waitress was new to her job. In every order something was wrong. She tried to be friendly but when my <ptag>steak</ptag> that I had asked well done came raw/medium an apology would have been nice. My waiting time was fifty minutes after all. Bring enough cash - no plastic accepted. And the phone number is <ntag>useless</ntag> too. We had tried to call beforehand but only got an answering machine. There's room for <ntag>improvement</ntag>, guys! The location sure is <ntag>nice</ntag>."
