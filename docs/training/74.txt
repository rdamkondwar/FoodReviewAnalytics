If you have cravings for <ptag>beef jerky</ptag>, I recommend ordering their <ptag>tuna</ptag>. And, if you aren't afraid of risking food poisoning, this may just be the right eatery for you. Their <ptag>sushi</ptag> comes with a days-old stench and apparent discoloration from staleness. (To top their disgusting fish in both appearance and taste, their manager refused to address the question regarding the fish delivery date multiple times. Instead, she condescendingly made a point of running the business for 15 years, which in result made her a <ptag>sushi</ptag> expert.) since when is continued refrigeration a guarantee for <ntag>freshness</ntag>, which was as blatantly absent as Bill Clinton at draft time. Been eating <ptag>sushi</ptag> around the world for 20 years but this was the most <ntag>arrogant</ntag>, stomach-churning and <ntag>ignorant</ntag> display of Japanese cuisine. Don't waste your taste buds or cash on this."
