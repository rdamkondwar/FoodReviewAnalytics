I quickly found out that they have a secret back room and had parted the curtains so our Elite after party could be more comfortable. Also, the look was great on the patrons faces when about 40 of us all waltzed into the place. \n\nIt's a cozy spot, but pretty bare for the most part, nothing fancy. The <ptag>draught beer</ptag> selection is sparse with only three options but this hole in the wall is all about the whiskey anyways. I'm not a whiskey drinker so I can't comment on the drinks but there certainly is a large number of options on their list."
"The Emmet Ray located on College at Dovercourt is a super cool whisky bar.  The atmosphere is very relaxed with hip and classy undertones.   The bar itself is a nice infusion of contemporary and classic/retro furnishings and decor.  Stained glass windows tastefully line the foyer as you enter and classic pot lights shine some light on the splendid bar.   Oh the bar.  This is by far one of my all time favourite bar menus.   They carry a vast selection of delicious <ptag>beer</ptag>, <ptag>gin</ptag>, <ptag>vodka</ptag>, wine, whisky and many more fine spirits.  They have a small food menu to satisfy some of your alcohol induced hunger cravings.  Throughout the week and weekend live music and DJs delightfully entertain thirsty patrons.  The bar keeps are very friendly, welcoming and accommodating.  The Emmet Ray Bar are purveyors of the finest alcohol and providers of fantastic live music!\n\nI highly recommend The Emmet Ray Bar!"
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place... maybe because it's hard to define what makes something one of your fave spots? \n\nVIBE\nSome tea lights and a few wing chairs up front by the windows, mostly tables/chairs/benches, a couch in the back I've never seen anyone use. \n\nUsually live jazz playing, too bad no one ever dances... except me occasionally, if I feel like kickin it Billy Idol stylez and dancing on my own.\n\nCool relaxed crowd, no feeling of a 'scene.' Seems to be the bar people come to when they finish their shift at another bar.\n\nGood looking, helpful bar staff. Yes even you Cal. \n\nLIBATIONS\nMassive whiskey and bourban list. My friend from Kentucky was impressed. Kentucky. Impressed with bourban. In Toronto. You gettin this? That's impressive.\n\nGreat beer selection. Pints are $5 before 9pm. Love me some Big Wheel.\n\nFOOD\nElegant casual, small portions, old faves with a twist. Get the chicken balls, dey so so good. \n\nEVENTS\nI hear Tuesday is craft night."
"Ahhhhhh....want to like it but I can't. They really really try way too hard to be a hispter bar....cheap beer though. The bartender also knew nothing about Scotch, but tried to tell me what to drink.....cheap beer though?\n\nEric"
"We came for the amazing whiskey selection, and left *so* happy with the level of service, live music and food at the Emmett Ray. I had the portobello mushroom deep dish pizza which was huge and so, so good. My friends had the chicken sandwich, chicken roti and the nachos. Everyone loved their food and we will definitely be back again. Highly recommend!!"
"Being a scotch whisky amateur, I was excited to attend a friend's birthday recently that was hosted by The Emmet Ray.\n\nWhat I noticed first and foremost was how cozy this place was.  Next, was the amazing bar where one could literally count hundreds of bottles of whisky, bourbon, scotch, beers.  The dim lit environment added to the overall ambiance that you were in a old, English whisky pub.  It was definitely not Irish, but Irish spirits are served none the less!\n\nTheir <ntag>selections</ntag> of their various spirits can be viewed through a menu.  For the scotch amateur such as myself, it was very overwhelming at first. But, after a few minutes, I began to recognize the main distillery offerings, and a few others I did not know that existed.  \n\nFor the evening, I settled on the Highland Park 18, Talisker 10, and the Oban 14.  Service was prompt and friendly, the two gents manning the bar was able to answer a few questions as to how best appreciate these single malts.  \n\nAs we were there for a birthday, we were confined to the room at the back for our own private event.  Bite sized portions of food was served, and amazingly enough, was delectably great - better than I was expecting!  I met their head chef, also whom I think is the owner that evening.  He had prepared Korean style short ribs, rice cooked in beans with braised slow cooked lamb, and spicy and sweet meatballs.  The lamb was absolutely amazing, very tender and flavorful full of sweet spices. \n\nNow these items may not be from the menu, but at least you know the range of selections are there should your party requests it.  At least, now I know the level of talent their chef is and it should surely translate into their regular food offerings.  I'll be sure to revisit at another date to sample their regular foods.  Did I mention they have whiskey pairings on the menu for all of their food items?\n\nDefinitely visit The Emmet Ray if you're a whiskey connoisseur, or like myself, pretending to be one.  \n\nUntil then, I'll be drowning deep in a dram of Talisker 10, my new favourite single malt!"
