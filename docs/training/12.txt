"I came here on a Saturday afternoon <ntag>excited</ntag> to try a <ntag>new</ntag> breakfast place, and the prices looked very <ntag>reasonable</ntag>.  There seem to be more and more overpriced breakfast places popping up these days, so it's reassuring to see a place charging well under $10 for an <ptag>Eggs</ptag> Benedict, and similarly good prices on other breakfast <ntag>items</ntag>.  There was a bit of a line to get in (on a Saturday), which I took to be a <ntag>good</ntag> sign.  It turns out that it may just be the dearth of <ntag>quality</ntag> breakfast places in the area that contributed to the wait.After we ordered, we were told that our food would be ready shortly, which was reassuring because the place was quite <ntag>full</ntag>.  30 minutes later, our two breakfasts arrived.  Unfortunately, my wife's <ptag>french toast</ptag> was <ntag>cold</ntag>, and the <ptag>bread</ptag> wasn't even soaked through with the batter - the middle was just plain white toast!  I saw them put the <ptag>french toast</ptag> up on the hot plate table (at the end, where the heat lamps don't reach) about 15 minutes before the rest of our meal, and it just sat there until the rest of the meal was ready!The rest of the meal was average breakfast fare; the <ptag>hash browns</ptag> were decent but a bit <ntag>salty</ntag> (but who goes to breakfast expecting health food, anyways?).  The <ptag>pancakes</ptag> were <ntag>mediocre</ntag> (they tasted like mix to me).  The service was OK.  I don't think I'll be going back, which is a shame because their prices are reasonable and they're one of the closest breakfast places.  Also, if they had simply said that there was a bit of a wait for the food as well, I think I would have been less <ntag>disappointed</ntag> that it took them 30 minutes to prepare two breakfasts.  That wouldn't have excused the cold <ptag>french toast</ptag>, though."
