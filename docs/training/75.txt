"I was jonesing for some Indian food on my last trip to </ptag>Toronto</ntag>.  I know there is a high concentrating of </ptag>Indian</ntag> people in </ptag>Toronto</ntag>/<ntag>Southern</ntag> <ntag>Ontario</ntag>, and all that was needed was to follow my nose to their outrageously scented but <ntag>delicious</ntag> cuisine.  A food court wasn't the idea I had when I pictured stuffing my face with Indian food, but what a food court they have in the <ntag>Eaton Center</ntag>!I had some kind of a spicy <ptag>chicken curry</ptag> with <ptag>chick peas</ptag> and <ptag>yellow rice</ptag>.  It was <ntag>all</ntag> <ntag>very</ntag> <ntag>good</ntag>, but the <ptag>garlic butter naan</ptag> was the best part.  You need to buy the <ptag>naan bread</ptag> separate, but you won't be disappointed if you do.Spending the rest of the day smelling like a bag of boiled onions and cumin was the collateral damage, but still worth it."
