The decor is unique.\n\nFor $200 including the gratuity, we got:\none margarita - per my daughter, it was amazing, octopus ceviche - was out of this world!, <ptag>Enchilada platter</ptag> - they were good,\nGrilled scallops with rice - was very good,\nSteak platter with enchilada and taquitos - Dad enjoyed it, <ptag>Soft steak tacos</ptag> - so, so\n\nIn my humble opinion, the dinner was not worth that much. Although the service was exceptional! Very friendly, attentive and professional service people."
"Never order steak here! It was tough and not good quality for its price.  Steak was also bland and it was almost well done :("
"Came in for dinner with a group of people from work. \n\nThe staff are hit and miss; some of them are nice and polite. while others are dismissive and not helpful. This includes management. \n\nThe decor is modern but has traditional Mexican elements. I like the design but wished lighting was a bit brighter.\n\nThe food: \nGuacamole - the order was like two small scoops of gelato. While it was good, it did not blow me away. <ptag>Queso Fundido</ptag> - this was cheesy good and I would order it again. I would also ask them to make it spicy somehow. It would have been better with bits of Chorizo in it. <ptag>Octopus and Shrimp Ceviche</ptag> - Both were fresh and tasted great. Portions again were small. These would be good as tapas style plates. <ptag>Carnitas</ptag> - The carnitas was surprisingly a larger portion. It came with a couple of medium size pork ribs and a chunk of pork butt. The flavors were good and there was a crunch from the deep-fried pork butt. It came with guacamole, tortillas, salsa, and pureed beans. These were some of the best beans I've had because it was luscious and creamy... I think from either lard or butter. \n\nOther people on the table had the Camerones Ranchero, Seafood Enchilada, Carne Asada and everyone seemed to like their dishes. \n\nNo desserts because we were too full from everything else. But the server did tell us they has fried bananas and flan. \n\nIn the end, I do not see myself coming back. There are a lot of other good local Mexican restaurants. But for tourists that want Mexican food, they don't really have much of a choice."
"Yes, it's more than you will pay for a taco at Los Tacos. Yes, the average entree is around $22. But, yes, that is how much it generally costs to eat on The Strip. With that out of the way, on to the important stuff: eats and environment. \n\nThe restaurant is expansive, open and sexy, which means it would make a solid date spot. Dark woods and conversation pieces, including an impressive rope centerpiece at the bar and a huge chainsaw carving, make dining here interesting and inviting. I have dined at a table and at the bar, and both spots were comfortable. And, we received great service at both.  The menu is extensive with options for everyone from a vegetarian to a steak lover to a pescatarian, so I think it will be easy to please everyone in a large party. Each meal starts with delicious <ptag>chips</ptag> and <ptag>salsa</ptag>, and if you want something with a strong kick, be sure to request the habanero salsa. The guac is not tableside, and it is pretty simple, but we have ordered it <ntag>both</ntag> times! As for entrees, my husband ordered the <ptag>Azul trio</ptag> which included a lobster enchilada, a <ptag>relleno stuffed</ptag> with crab and a shrimp taco. I could spy drool spilling from the corners of his mouth just looking at the plate. I have sampled the Chicken Picado (menu only has steak, but they made chicken by request) and the Mole. Both were fresh, well-prepared and generous.I can't say that the food is conquering new territories of culinary adventure, but they do Mexican well. \n\nI also spied tables with the tablita, a giant tray for two people to share create your own tacos. Next time, I want to try that. \n\nI haven't tried a margarita here, but listening to the bartenders, it sounds like they can make a primo one. \n\nOverall, what really pushes Javier's into a spot worth trying is the amazing ambiance and solid service. If you get there and there is a wait, remember bar seating is all first come, first serve!"
"Huge disappointment.   Best chips and salsa, not! Had taco dinner, no taste at all and the chicken and steak was overcooked and cold.  My husbands dinner also overcooked.  Passed up a great Italian dinner to try this place.  Big mistake.  Way overpriced for what we got.  The music was too loud and so dark we could hardly read the menu.  The only thing good about this place was the service.  Too bad the food isn't as good as the service."
