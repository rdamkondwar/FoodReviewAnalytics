So, here is why it is bad.1) the portions are small on every <ptag>sandwich</ptag> that we ordered. Four different sandwiches. This is compared to other Arby's I've eaten at.2) they say they don't have any monthly deals. I was told they belong to the same owner as the one on Park and they have <ntag>monthly</ntag> deals.3) tried it twice and both times they messed up our order. We paid but did not get things.4) their customer service is <ntag>awful</ntag>I don't expect much in life but when I go somewhere to give them my money , I expect <ntag>better</ntag> than what I got here."
