"Wife and I just tried this for the first time and enjoyed the experience. I <ntag>got</ntag> the mint with Oreo and she got the <ptag>cookie</ptag> butter. In my opinion, both lacked depth of flavor so I'd rate the <ptag>ice cream</ptag> a 3/5. The experience, people, and atmosphere were all 4s and the place was <ntag>packed</ntag> so overall they get a 4 in my book. Definitely worth a try if you are in the area."
