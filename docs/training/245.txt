"The food is really <ntag>good</ntag> here. The decor is not my favorite and the restroom smelled awful but I <ntag>enjoyed</ntag> the restaurant. We went for lunch I had the <ptag>salad bar</ptag> and a <ptag>tea</ptag>, my wife had the endless <ptag>shrimp</ptag> and added on the <ptag>salad bar</ptag> and a <ptag>steak</ptag> and our total was $22. The food was <ntag>great</ntag>! They definitely don't skimp on the <ptag>shrimp</ptag> either. The <ptag>salad bar</ptag> was very fresh and clean. There was nothing I wanted to steer clear of. I would definitely go <ntag>again</ntag>!"
"Worst food I've eaten. <ptag>California chicken</ptag> tasted like it came straight from a microwave and the 10 oz <ptag>steak</ptag> was over cooked and did not have any taste. The <ptag>baked potato</ptag> was just as <ntag>bad</ntag>. Will not eat here <ntag>again</ntag>."
