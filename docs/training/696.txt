I got the </ptag>pumpkin cheesecake<ptag> <ntag>soft</ntag> serve in a <ptag>waffle</ptag> cone and my husband got the mint oreo <ptag>sundae</ptag>. Mine was ok but weakly flavored. The mint oreo <ptag>sundae</ptag> was gross. It was plain oreos crushed up in a cup with vanilla soft serve and very fake flavored mint syrup. The syrup wasn't mixed in, it was layerd in between the <ptag>ice cream</ptag> and the <ptag>cookies</ptag>. We probably won't be back. <ntag>Handel's</ntag> and <ntag>Stricklands</ntag> are still our favorites."
