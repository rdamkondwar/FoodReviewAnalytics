"This Mr. Sub is <ntag>super</ntag> garbage. I ordered the <ptag>rib sub</ptag> which is being advertised a lot right now. And I actually remember a <ptag>rib sub</ptag> I used to <ntag>get</ntag> there when I was a kid, and loved it. But this was no trip down memory lane. They basically didn't know what went on the <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. They asked me what I wanted, and I actually pointed to the poster for <ntag>reference</ntag>. They then told me they didn't have half those things and <ptag>cheese</ptag> was an extra $1 (wtf?!). The <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was surprisingly <ntag>gross</ntag>."
