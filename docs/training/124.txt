"I stopped into this <ntag>new</ntag> coffee shop today after reading about it on AZ Central. I was <ntag>excited</ntag> to see what they did with the old Amsterdam bar.. When I arrived, I found it a little difficult to <ntag>park</ntag> because it's located on a one way street ...so for everyone trying to park, make sure that you go South one street to pierce and then turn into the small road to the left side of the light rail so that you can turn into their parking lot. The place has very cute decor, with clocks showing the time  in different parts of the world(you know, grand central themed). They have a loft area upstairs and ample seating downstairs (the perfect place to hang out and study or chat with friends). The staff were all friendly and helpful. They source their <ptag>coffee</ptag> from infusion <ptag>coffee</ptag> and <ptag>tea</ptag> in <ntag>Tempe</ntag> and get their <ptag>chai</ptag> from David Rio. Essentially the drinks here are like the drinks at <ntag>infusion</ntag> <ptag>Coffee</ptag> and <ptag>Tea</ptag> (aka delish), but far closer to my house (even better). They also have a full bar and many <ptag>beer</ptag> taps (a variety of local and nonlocal craft brews at a decent price point). Their happy hour right now is from 11 to 7...most excellent. I know I will be making many return trips to <ntag>Grand Central</ntag> and recommend you do the same!"
"Excellent range of craft <ptag>beer</ptag> on tap! Super cool atmosphere! Once kitchen is <ntag>up</ntag> and running will be a great new downtown spot!"
"<ntag>Awesome</ntag> place for the neighborhood.  Always nice when you can get a <ptag>coffee</ptag> or a <ptag>beer</ptag> or <ptag>wine</ptag>.  <ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> on tap. Friendly staff.  Remodel they did looks <ntag>great</ntag>.  Love the vibe."
