"When they tell you to get there at 7pm even though the show starts at 9pm, you go. \n\nThe place gets packed... like super duper packed... I sat there almost at the front looking for the fire exits and wondering how many people I would have to shove to get to one. Our friend ran across the street from our hotel to get tickets, but instead had to call a number and buy them over the phone... even though she could hear the lady inside talking to her. They also have a Heckling Deposit: ten pounds a person in your party and you also get thrown out. I think it's more of a Good Behaviour Deposit. \n\nSince we were having dinner there, we had to eat in shifts. There were four of us to a table and they're really small. Ordering is at the bar, you tell them your table and then they bring you your food pretty fast. Our friends ordered the <ptag>nachos</ptag> and then some mains, so they had to have an extra tray on their laps for all the food.  I thought the food was good. I heard dismal things about the nachos and the mac and cheese, but our friends were happy with the lamb burger (words like best lamb burger ever were used) and said the burrito was okay. I had the bangers and mash. Nothing wrong with <ntag>gravy</ntag>, sausage and potatoes. Joanne (is that her name?) was a great host. She asked everyone in what equates to gyno row their names and where they're from. She's really funny and quick witted. I would pay to listen to her. I don't remember that much of the other comics... we saw four that night. All entertaining, but I remember the last one for sure... not his name, but he sounded like a minister from Southern USA. Pretty irreverent and that's what made him funny. \n\nWe didn't hang around after the comics were finished. We left pretty quick after that. Didn't want to lose our Good Behaviour Deposit."
