Yes please!\nThis adorable little basement shop in Westmount is so worth a visit.\nIt is much larger than it appears from the street and is really lovely inside.\nGo at lunch and grab a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> - the Smoking Goat (smoked salmon, goat cheese and capers) and The Mexican (gouda with cumin, avocado and black olives) are absolutely wonderful.\nLovely staff, amazing selection of cheeses, prices aren't terrible.\nCan't wait for my next sandwich there!"
"Great little place to stop by for wonderful soup and a superb sandwich. They don't skimp on the fillings in their sandwiches, there's always plenty of cheese and meat, interesting condiments and loads of vegetables. The soups are homemade and always the right thing on a cold afternoon.\n\nThere are only a few tables here, so either you have to get there before the crowds, or possibly squeeze up to the window counter to eat.\n\nI often buy my cheese here, the prices are reasonable and the staff is quite knowledgeable."
"One of the nicest sandwich  place  in Montreal.  They would  have  earned  5 starts  if the staff was little  friendlier..."
"A great little neighbourhood gem if you are in the area.  It's a sandwich place, but also a cheese and fine groceries shop.  Their sandwiches are excellent, the bread is super fresh and all their ingredients top quality.  The smoking goat is my favorite.  Lots of choices, something for everyone here.  Soups and salads are just ok, I'd stick with the sandwiches.  They have a nice selection of cheeses, cold cuts and condiments, salts, etc as well.  The inside is a little crowded with limited seating; in the summer there is more seating outside.  Service is friendly and efficient."
"I love this place, I go all the time, but the guy working there who is there all the time, dark hair, short, not friendly (if you go there a lot you'll know who I'm talking about), is so rude, he messed up my order a few times, he used his hands to spread the chicken onto my sandwich, prepares the food using his fingers and handles money.. Not sanitary at all. He's so unpleasant to deal with and when I go there I will definitely be asking for a different person.\nIt's such a shame because I love the food but he really ruins the experience."
"Honestly, I am a sucker for any place that serves more than one variety of cream of [vegetable/legume] a day, but the fact of the matter is that Foumagerie just has good food in general. Besides the tasty soups, you'll find a wide variety of sandwiches built around a variety of cheeses, from Parmesan to Stilton. The cheese is fantastic, the cold cuts are high-quality and the bread is always fresh from their bakery.\n\nThe place is super small, so on days when it's too cold and wet for them to open up the terrace, you might have a hard time getting a seat, but the turnover's pretty good and you can easily take your meal to go.\n\nAn extra recommendation goes specifically to the Carpaccio sandwich on baguette: roast beef, lemon juice, black pepper, olive oil and a generous helping of parmesan cheese make it less of a sandwich and more of an experience. Awesome."
"Husband and I are staying in Montreal and trying to find a bakery or shop that has delicious baguette sandwiches. The level of deliciousness similar to that in France. Day 3, no luck. I found this place by reading yelp reviews and decided to give this place a go. Especially since they have lots and lots of cheeses! Cannot go wrong with that. \nI ordered a soup (not too crazy about it) and a custom sandwich with salmon, avocado, tomato, lettuce and their dressing of olive oil & lemon. That's what I was looking for! It was perfectly crunchy and had a good balance of flavors and textures inside! Score!\nHubby ordered their main sandwich special, something Parmesan prosciutto. It was also quite tasty, however, a bit intense. I think you need to have an acquired taste for something this salty, or have more lettuce or something bland to balance it out more. Overall a pleasant experience, staff very friendly and knowledgeable."
