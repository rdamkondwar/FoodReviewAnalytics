"I've had the <ptag>kung pao chicken</ptag>, <ptag>beef</ptag> with <ntag>sauce</ntag>, several <ptag>dumpling</ptag> types, <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag>, <ptag>curry noodles</ptag>, and <ptag>singapore noodles</ptag>. The <ptag>kung pao chicken</ptag> was ok. I wouldn't get the <ptag>beef</ptag> with <ntag>sauce</ntag> again. I felt it was pretty much all <ptag>rice</ptag>. I also don't like their <ptag>dumplings</ptag> very much. The filling doesn't have a very <ntag>good</ntag> flavor. The <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag> was very, very vinegary. The <ptag>curry noodles</ptag> were <ntag>ok</ntag>. I think they could have been cooked longer. Everyone liked the <ptag>singapore noodles</ptag> They were probably the <ntag>best</ntag>. Followed by the <ptag>kung pao chicken</ptag>. The employees are <ntag>nice</ntag> and the food is cooked quickly"
