"Our server, Jim, was wonderfully attentive for our party of 14. We are the Second Saturday dinner club that chooses a new restaurant each month. I loved the <ptag>Sirloin</ptag> and the <ptag>Gnocchi</ptag> to start. The <ptag>steak</ptag> was <ntag>cooked</ntag> perfectly. Easily worth the trip to visit this <ntag>great</ntag> place. #secondsaturday"
