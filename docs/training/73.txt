Since it's a diner I decided on something <ntag>greasy</ntag> & <ntag>fried</ntag>, like <ptag>chicken strips</ptag> & gravy, my usual at these kind of places.  The gravy was <ntag>delicious</ntag> but the <ptag>chicken strips</ptag> tasted & looked exactly like the <ntag>cheap</ntag> ones that you buy in the freezer section & heat up. Really bad.  I could tell these were def not hand <ptag>breaded</ptag> which was <ntag>disappointing</ntag>.  My husband got a grilled <ptag>ham & cheese sandwich</ptag> which he said was good but pretty greasy. As for the service, they were all so <ntag>sweet</ntag> but the food didn't wow us one bit. Sad to say, I probably won't be back."
