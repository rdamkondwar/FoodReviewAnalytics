There's always a nice but overcrowded shelve of clearance food items at <ntag>great</ntag> prices, that they stock up near the evening.With the free Waitrose card <ntag>you</ntag> can get a daily free newspaper (I believe with a minimum purchase of 5 pounds or so) and free <ptag>coffee</ptag> or <ptag>tea</ptag>.Just the fact that they have Bundaberg Ginger <ptag>beer</ptag> makes me very happy and a fan! We also purchased our towels and some other starters household items and they've all been very high quality, and one of the cheapest we've seen around oddly! Just need to look around for the deals in <ntag>there</ntag>, generally a bit more <ntag>expensive</ntag> store otherwise, but nice variety!"
"I used to be a MASSIVE fan of <ntag>waitrose</ntag>. I would come here for all my foody delights, be it for a beautiful <ptag>tart</ptag>, fresh vegetables, or good veggie food.Recently, I have worked out that a lot of it is just good marketing. Like Waitrose, marks and spencers also sells itself as being a slightly more upmarket, luxurious brand. This really rings true when one tries their ready meals, which are superb in comparison to <ntag>Tesco</ntag>. That said, I'm not a big one for ready meals, so let's take a look at some of the other fresh produce:Fruit and vegetables: Good selection, a few slightly more exotic options like <ptag>pak choi</ptag> and <ptag>enoki mushrooms</ptag>. They also often sell <ptag>blood oranges</ptag>. These options are expensive though, and dare I say it, inferior to the ones at lidls. Bakery: Wonderful fresh <ptag>French bread</ptag> and <ptag>croissants</ptag>. Not so wonderful <ptag>cakes</ptag>."
