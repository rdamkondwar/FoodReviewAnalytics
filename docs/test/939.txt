"We have been to Persis several times and have never been disappointed. The wait staff is very helpful and attentive, particularly Joseph. Our favorite is <ptag>Methi Chicken</ptag>, borders on being addictive! Our last visit included the <ptag>Tandoori Lamb</ptag> appetizer, marinated in yogurt and spices, so tasty and tender, arrives at your table on a sizzling platter with grilled onions, peppers....YUM!! Also tried the Hayward 5000 beer, mild flavor, very good. They are also very helpful concerning menu selections regarding wheat allergy. Looking forward to our next meal at Persis!"
