"Started out looking for a decent happy hour. Web site showed a burger. Arrived,...not allowed to sit on patio and eat off the happy hour menu. You have eat at the bar or sit on a couch. \nTried the bar. \"The burger is not on the happy hour menu anymore and the website has not been updated\". Ordered <ptag>beer battered fish tacos</ptag> and they were out of them. \nHow about the drinks? You could serve them to children they are truly that weak. This is my second time here, the drinks were weak last time as well. Too bad about the food, because the decor is really unique. \n\nUpdate the website today!!\nHappy hour is regulated by the clock not the chair you sit on!! 3 to 6pm no other phony rules.\nIf you are out of a menu item then the server knows it and corrects it. Make something up. Drinks should cross your eyes and the ice should correct the perfect pour if you have a tiny bit of patience!!!"
"4 stars for the food, but only 3 for service. We had brunch there and and it was our first visit. Portions are huge and the menu has a lot of choices. We both had pancakes and they were delicious. Service was definitely lacking though it wasn't that busy and there were several people working. Our server acted like we were inconveniencing her when I asked for more water. Because of the food we'd like to go back and try the dinner menu. Hopefully evening service will be better."
"Bit off of a dinner spot with some hits and misses. 3.5 stars Food: 3.5, Service: 3, Atmosphere: 3\nCost to worth it rating: 2 (pretty spendy for variable quality, most entrees mid to high $20s)\nOpentableable: yes, kid's menu: yes\nReturn worthiness: probably not\n\nHighlights:\n- Pork chop: cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. Accompanied by this large mashed sweet potato in a puff pastry which was stellar as well. 4.5 stars\n- Clams: good amount with a lovely broth and small strips of bacon. 4 stars\n- Pretzel bites: puffy nubbins which tasted almost donutty. 3.5 stars \n- Patio lounge: looked cool to sit back and have a drink.\n\nMidlights: \n <ptag>Jalapeno margarita</ptag>-   I've had several of these other places yet this one was overly spicy. Could see the seeds floating in the glass and I got to numb lip status drinking it.\n <ntag>Entertainment</ntag> - had a guitar singer duo who were great and playing a variety of tunes, but just didn't seem to mesh with the dinner vibe. \n\nLowlights:\n- <ptag>Steak frites</ptag> type entree: very sad small portion of 4 slices of steak on the top of a bunch of fries. Devoid of flavor too and one of the more expensive dishes on the menu. 2 stars.\n <ntag>Service</ntag> -  Seemed super thrown off by a large party in back on a Friday night. Wanted to push our reservation up a half hour and they said they could not. We got there on time with the restaurant mostly empty and even then took a bit to get our table organized and longer to get our food.\n\nGlad some of the good items were good but since there are so many places in the area, I'll probably try some others when I visit next."
"First meal in Scottsdale. We made a great decision to eat here. The restaurant and service was really good. The food was delicious. Everything was made from scratch. The owner/executive chef even came out to ask my daughter what kind of pasta she likes. She made her a special chicken pasta in cream sauce. My wife and I ended up eating some of it. We'll definitely try to come back here before going back home to Cali."
"Great new addition to the neighborhood.  I used to go way out of my way to the sister restaurant, Soul Cafe, in North Scottsdale just to have their <ptag>green chili burro</ptag> for <ntag>breakfast</ntag> - but now I don't have to.  Alma has several great menu items and some of the biggest pancakes that I've ever seen.  Plus, they've got a great selection of beers on draft (I highly recommend the Deschutes Freshly Squeezed for any IPA lovers - great accompaniment to green chili!).  Better yet, they have Happy Days... not just happy hour... 7 AM to 6:00 PM, which means 16 ounces of pure deliciousness for only $4.00 a glass.  The service, especially Veronica and Justin, is attentive and very friendly.  The owner clearly takes pride in her establishment and makes a point to visit with the customers as she is able.  I'll be back often."
