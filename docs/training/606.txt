"I went to <ntag>Spring Sushi</ntag> on a Friday night and was mildly impress by it. The only selling point I see was the fact that you could order on an <ntag>iPad</ntag> and get descriptions on items that you weren't familiar with. To me, this is a great concept if you were to come with a big group.The food itself was <ntag>alright</ntag>. Nothing to really complaint or comment about if you have been to enough places. I did enjoy the <ntag>crispy</ntag> <ptag>bean</ptag> <ptag>curd</ptag> <ptag>avocado roll</ptag>. The <ptag>sashimi</ptag> was <ntag>good</ntag> but the portion itself was a little small compare to other places I've been to. I tried the BBQ Beef Rib which was small and majority of it was fat (not what I anticipated) and the teppanyaki sirloin <ptag>steak</ptag> with <ntag>garlic</ntag> was disappointing.One of my <ntag>favourite</ntag> things to get is spider rolls when I go for <ptag>sushi</ptag> and the one from Spring <ptag>Sushi</ptag> was way too <ntag>salty</ntag>!!! I was quite disappointed.Overall, the place was <ntag>alright</ntag>. The food itself was <ntag>typical</ntag> and nothing to rave about."
