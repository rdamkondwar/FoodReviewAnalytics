"<ntag>Great</ntag> food!!! Had the <ntag>rose' sauce</ntag> on <ptag>pasta</ptag> with <ptag>Caesar salad</ptag>.  <ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> selection too. Our waitress was very <ntag>attentive</ntag>, <ntag>friendly</ntag> and fast.  We saw the <ptag>pizza</ptag> go by and it looked <ntag>amazing</ntag>.  We were visiting family in the area and liked the location.  Close to Vegas but less traffic and prices were lower, although the food was <ntag>better</ntag> than any we tried in Las Vegas.   We will return!"
