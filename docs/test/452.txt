"Delicious assortment of Mexican specialties at this little stand in the West Side Market. We opted for a <ptag>pork tamale</ptag>, <ptag>chicken empanada</ptag>, and <ptag>flank steak quesadilla</ptag> - which totalled a whopping $9 and they even heated everything up for us to eat right then and there! Being a snob of Mexican food I have to say that this stuff passes the test. Give it a shot next time you're in the Market."
