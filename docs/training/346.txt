"No.You can buy a <ntag>little</ntag> takeout thingy of <ptag>sushi</ptag> here for over $20. Why do that when you can buy like four of the same thing from <ntag>Loblaws</ntag> for the same price?Ok ok, so <ntag>Pusateris</ntag> is high quality or whatever. Big deal.I might actually be convinced to like this place if it weren't for the fact that someone I know worked here.At the end of the day, every day, she was instructed to throw away all of the <ptag>bread</ptag> they have. None of the <ntag>cashiers</ntag> can take any of it home. If they don't sell it within the day, they're discarded.I didn't think high quality garbage existed until I heard that."
