"I <ntag>hate</ntag> to say that I'm not such a big fan. If going out for lunch I'm likely to pick the <ptag>sushi rolls</ptag> on <ntag>Dundas</ntag>, or <ptag>Sushi</ptag> on <ntag>Baldwin</ntag>, or <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> at <ntag>Avenue Bistro</ntag>. But, on the occasion I do get to leave work for lunch, I have a few friends who drag me to <ntag>Sage</ntag>. My gripes: All the food tastes like stuff I can make at home. The <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> are not grilled, hot or tasty. If you pay for a filling, the wraps are often filled with more <ptag>lettuce</ptag> than filling. The <ptag>Noodles</ptag> are <ntag>greasy</ntag> but <ntag>bland</ntag>. the <ptag>soup</ptag> was bland. I've really given it my all, but everything I eat here is underwhelming. Although Margs recommends avoiding the lunch hour, they close at the ungodly early hour for 4pm, so its always either busy or closed. Still only going if my friends drag me."
