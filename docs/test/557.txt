"I think this is one of the best Japanese/Asian fastfood/rice bowl places in the valley.  I have been going to them for over 10 years when I have worked at various places in the Tempe area.  They have really good rice bowls and a large variety of toppings to put in them, from curry to teriyaki to bulgogi to spicy chicken, chili chicken and good veggies.   I really like the <ptag>miso soup</ptag> they have and often order that as a side. I would like to see a couple of things: a smaller side dish of california rolls, and soup.  On the lunch combos, I'd like to see a bit more flexibility with a choice of entree and two sides rather than a list of set entrees and sides.  Normally this might subtract a star from the "As good as it gets" rating but Tokyo Stop has been consistently good to me for so long that they get the bonus star.  They also get a bonus for taking American Express (they used to not)."
"I feel like Ron Burgundy as he bashes frozen yogurt for trying to be anything like his beloved ice cream and tries to give it zero stars. In this case, how dare you call your \"chicken katsu\" .... chicken katsu. \n\nI've been craving chicken katsu for days and saw this place during my errands. To keep it short, when you order <ptag>chicken katsu</ptag> you will not get chicken katsu, not even close. You will instead get barely fried/soft pieces of chicken (think teriyaki chicken); not even the right breading nor the right part of the chicken they usually use. Also, they will give you Katsu sauce, but it's really hoisin sauce. I thought all of this was a horrible mistake, but that's how they do things there. Talk about confusing and misleading, I feel like I ordered a <ptag>hamburger</ptag> and got a fish filet instead."
"absolutely the worst place i've eaten in. i ordered <ptag>tempura udon</ptag> and <ptag>soup</ptag> had like dried bamboo sprouts? it smelled like shit and the whole udon bowl tasted so disgusting. too much carrot and overall, not worth the price you pay. my sister ordered <ptag>spicy ramen</ptag> i tried to taste the soup and it was way too salty. not going back to this place ever. i ended up eating the mochis that i bought from the japanese market in the same shopping mall for dinner. we left over half because of the weird smell in the food."
"I looked over at some other folks eating meat over rice, and those looked like better offerings. Sadly, the ramen was on par with dorm room cooking and should be avoided. \n\nThe noodles were actually not half bad, it was everything else that let it down. And what was up with dining in out of a paper soup bowl? The pork slices were dry and bland. Not even a good soak in the just salty broth could wake it up. Interestingly half of the bowl was <ntag>filled</ntag> with bean sprouts. In itself that's not a problem, but it meant that it took up room that could have been occupied by some other treats.\n\nNot a ramen stop by any means. Of note, it's next to a Japanese grocery store and a Japanese bakery."
"Really enjoyed the Tokyo Stop. I'm a huge bulgogi/yakiniku fan so the fact that they offered it was a big plus to start with. I'm not huge on veggies in my bulgogi though so thats what cost it a star. It was very tasty however and a large portion. The fact that a Japanese place calls it bulgogi sorta threw me a little bit. Like some others on here I was wondering if it was Japanese or Korean too. I'm going Japanese as the owner & I had a lovely conversation about my time living in Japan. He commented "I miss Japan" and, of course, I said "I do too". Anyone that knows me or my family knows these words are uttered several times a week in our house, usually after waxing sentimental about my beloved MOS Burger. I'll have to try the curry that Matthew K. recommends. Its a tossup as to whether curry or yakiniku is my fav food in the world."
