"The thing I hate about these theaters is that they have a so-called specialty called XD, a wannabe IMAX type of thing. It's nothing special (to me) and they charge you more. Sometimes, there isn't even an option to watch it non-XD. Rip off, right? That's my warning! Other than that, this theater has been <ntag>satisfactory</ntag> the multiple times I have been. The best part is that <ntag>Steak N Shake</ntag> is right below via escalator and you can sneak food into the theater. Shhhhh... I never said that."
