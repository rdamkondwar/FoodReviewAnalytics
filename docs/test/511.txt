"Frys prices and tons of variety.  You can drink wine in the store.  Beer selection not bad but not on the level of Whole Foods across the street.  Beer minus one star.  Selection could be better for a store going toe to toe against Whole Foods. <ntag>Sushi</ntag> - minus one star.  There sushi straight sucks.  \n\nWill add another star back to get this up to a 4 star because of Frys low prices which kick Whole Foods overpriced ass.\n\nBut if you really want top quality food and drink, no one in the valley beats Whole Foods.  Not even AJ's"
"I'm definitely one of those people who hates grocery shopping. Ugh.. What a chore. However... This Fry's makes the experience much less painful, even (gasp!) enjoyable at times! \nFirst, it is very very clean. Upon entering you first approach produce which is adjacent to a <ptag>salad bar</ptag>, <ptag>Olive bar</ptag>, <ptag>soup bar</ptag>, <ptag>fresh pizza</ptag> to-go, and a wine bar! (They serve beer also). On the days I haven't prepared I'll enjoy a glass of wine while I write out my list. The selection is always changing and the bartender is very knowledgeable. Behind that is where the alcohol aisles are, including a nice prestigious little room of the fancier wines. I'm not that fancy so I haven't explored it but it looks to carry the boutique wines for the more experienced winos. The whole store has so much to offer - good selection of organic, kosher, Mediterranean, Hispanic, fine cheese, real Italian pasta... I feel confident it could compete well with the boutique delis on the area for some of the specialities (maybe not Andreoli deli, but def Chompies). \nThe pharmacy area has replaced my need to stop by Walgreens with the exception of my face wash. The prices on soap, lotion, shave gel, etc are very competitive with <ntag>Walgreens</ntag> or Target. \nThe guys at check out snd self check out get things done quickly. Oh, and stop by the in-store Cornerstone Creamery on your way out for some ice cream. It always smells delish!!\nThis is definitely my fave grocery store in the entire Scottsdale area."
