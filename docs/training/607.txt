I ended up going with the ugly <ptag>cookie</ptag> which was so good and not overly <ntag>sweet</ntag>. I tried a bite of my husband's <ptag>Monona bar</ptag> which was <ntag>good</ntag> but <ntag>super</ntag> <ntag>sweet</ntag>. My mom had the <ptag>mint sandwich cookie</ptag> that would have been even better with some <ptag>ice cream</ptag>. <ntag>Great</ntag> addition to the <ntag>Atwood</ntag> area and fun place to stop for an afternoon break."
