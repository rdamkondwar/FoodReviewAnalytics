"I ate here the other night and found everything to be satisfactory. We live fairly close and we were <ntag>hungry</ntag> and I had just gotten back from the gym so I didn't want anything too heavy. We sat down and our server greeted us promptly. We ordered a couple drinks,<ptag>wine</ptag> for my fiance and a <ptag>beer</ptag> for me. I originally ordered a <ptag>purple haze</ptag> which I was stoked for, but they were out so I settled for a shock top. Can't pass up a $4 draft. My fianc\u00e9 was starving and ordered a cup of soup right away, which was a coconut <ptag>curry</ptag> of some sort. It came out promptly. And for being a cup it was absolutely massive. Good start. He had a tiki <ptag>chicken</ptag> something or other, which our server, recommended. I had the gyro, which I always order. This time I added the <ntag>garlic</ntag> <ptag>potatoes</ptag>. Everything was really good. I ordered my gyro without <ntag>pickles</ntag> because they always put a zillion on, but it came out with <ntag>pickles</ntag>. Oh well. I'm not the type to throw a stink. I actually like the flavor of the pickles in there, there are just usually way too many. I just pulled them off and my pickle pile wasn't as big as it usually is there. The <ptag>potatoes</ptag> were <ntag>good</ntag>. I love <ptag>garlic</ptag>, which is a good thing because these are intense. We had the <ptag>baklava bread pudding</ptag> for dessert which I've had in the past and this was by far the best one I've had. It took a long time, but we were told it was being made fresh. I could tell for sure that it was fresh and it was absolutely worth the wait. Also. The price sure is right at Pita Jungle. Our bill was $48 all in for 2 alcoholic beverages, a cup of <ptag>soup</ptag>, <ntag>big</ntag> dessert and a 22% tip. So you really can't beat that on a Friday night in <ntag>Scottsdale</ntag>."
