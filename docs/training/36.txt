"I have always loved <ptag>Quiznos Subs</ptag> and was a bummed when so many locations closed.\nThat being said I am glad this location is still around. They are always fast, friendly, and\ncourteous. The only problem I had was the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> should have been cooked a little longer on the belt, it seemed a little soggy and would have been better if they didn't pull it out of the belt so early."
"This is the first time that we have been to this establishment while living in Phoenix.. I really had a taste for <ntag>Quiznos</ntag> and they did not disappoint. Very very friendly employees and my sandwich was made quickly and correctly. Will be going back again thank you"
"Great <ptag>toasted sandwich</ptag>. The owners are very nice. And they have Miss Vickies Salt & Vinegar Chips! They are so hard to find."
"Of all the sub places out there today, eating at this Quizno's today, I recall what a great sandwich they make!\n\n* Better than Subway, far better;\n* better than Capriotti's \n(I don't understand mixing white and dark meat; am I the only one that that's that discriminating?); and \n* better than Jimmy Johns\ncome on now!  Mediocre cold cuts, lots of mustard and delivery. And that's all they got. \n\nI like the Quizno's product, I like the \"fix-ins' bar and let me tell you, THE OWNERS/OPERATORS of THIS QUIZNO's LOCATION ARE EASILY THE NICEST, MOST GRACIOUS PEOPLE IN ALL ARIZONA!!!!!!\n\n(See, the <ptag>pink lemonade</ptag> dispensing machine was broken, and really, that was the reason that I stopped in. They retrieved the product for me, from the back, which they didn't have to do.)\n\nTry THIS location!!  And thank you Quizno's store 03607!"
"Post Quiznos bankruptcy, it is very difficult to find a location that is still in operation.  This Mesa location is pretty hard to beat when it comes to total dining experience.  I will drive way out of my way to come to this location simply because I always leave happy.  I won't comment on the food, because it is standard Quiznos fair done well.  I journey to this location because of the people that work here.  The franchise owners love their store and love what they do.  They are present, and they actually deliver service with a smile which is very rare in today's retail environment.  The store is spotless and well appointed which leaves you with nothing to worry about except what types of peppers and sauce to enhance your sandwich.  So far I have not found another restaurant in Mesa that delivers like these people do."
