"very impressed with how much the <ptag>pizza</ptag> tastes like NYC <ptag>pizza</ptag>, the prices are very fair and the delivery person and timing was excellent.very clean and family friendly"
"We went to this <ntag>place</ntag> tonight as we have many times.  Tonight while my husband was eating his <ptag>pizza</ptag> he chewed on a <ptag>nut</ptag> from a screw.  Due to him being diabetic he had to eat his portion of the <ptag>pizza</ptag>.  My half was plain and I found what appeared to be a thin stick.  I left my half of the <ptag>pizza</ptag>.  The owner, rather than offering us a refund offered us a piece of cheesecake.  I was appalled.  Suppose my husband had broken a tooth or swallowed this <ptag>nut</ptag> from a <ntag>screw.  I am seriously considering <ntag>calling</ntag> the Board of Health on Monday."
"First time I came here I was dismayed by the <ptag>pizza</ptag> being served. I don't want to go into the details of what I felt the <ptag>pizza</ptag> lacked (<ptag>cheese</ptag>, oil, <ptag>marinara</ptag>, <ptag>tomatoes</ptag>, etc.) But I came back and the small, unique hole in the wall responded with almost good <ptag>pizza</ptag>. That is <ntag>a</ntag> step in <ntag>the</ntag> right durection. They even have their own <ntag>sauce</ntag> for sale as well and I think next time I go I will by a jar. From dismay to <ntag>delight</ntag>. Well transformed. Keep it up and the five stars will be yours to claim."
"Called to place an order for delivery. Ordered LG thin crust <ptag>Pepperoni</ptag> /blk olive easy on the <ptag>cheese</ptag>. Husband really liked it and he's a picky philly italian, especially when it comes to <ptag>pizza</ptag> crust...he was very pleased!    Now to the other order...ordered a <ptag>chicken parm</ptag> and  <ptag>broccoli rabe</ptag> <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. Which looked incredible! For those of you familiar w/broccoli rabe know it DOESN'T LOOK OR TASTE ANYTHING LIKE <ptag>BROCCOLI</ptag>. I can't think of a single <ntag>good</ntag> reason why they would put <ptag>broccoli</ptag> NOT <ptag>broccoli rabe</ptag> on my <ptag>chicken parm sandwich</ptag>. I sure hope they weren't trying to sneak one over on me.Most likely I'll give them the benifit of the doubt and probably try them again though. The <ptag>chicken</ptag> was fried nicely w/a tasty pepper and oil wetness to it, also , it was a very big <ptag>sandwich</ptag> !"
"<ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>pizza</ptag>, <ntag>good</ntag> prices. Atmosphere inside is authentic and it shows. People are friendly. Place is <ntag>clean</ntag> and tidy. <ptag>Pizza</ptag> is cooked in a timely fashion and to perfection."
