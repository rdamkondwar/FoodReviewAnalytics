We ordered the platter for four to share among 4 adults and 2 young kids. The stack of <ntag>meat</ntag> on the platter was quite impressive. The <ptag>cabbage rolls</ptag> which came with the platter were <ntag>excellent</ntag>. I particularly liked the broth which I soaked up with the <ptag>rye bread</ptag>. The <ptag>schnitzel</ptag> and <ptag>pork chops</ptag> were <ntag>tender</ntag> and <ntag>tasty</ntag>, seasoned and cooked just right. The pickled <ptag>cucumber slices</ptag> although on the sweet side were also quite good. All of us including the kids enjoyed our meal very much.I should also give kudos to our server, one person taking care of the almost full restaurant, she took care of all our needs."
