"I tried this place a few times and they are always busy.  Tried their <ptag>beef noodle</ptag> in regular noodle and another kind which I don't remember the English name they used but Chinese is \u5200\u524a\u9eb5. Both are good and have good amount of meat in it. However, I like the <ntag>location</ntag> in Pacific mall food court better and that was the first time I tried the noodle soup and their beef tastes better for some reason. Maybe I should go there again for second try. Overall,  this location is still good and like that they open till 10pm."
"I was excited to try this noodle place after seeing the photos on their door and on yelp. And so I convinced my family to try out this relatively new restaurant instead of getting ramen. When you first enter there was this weird \"wash cloth\" smell and they were playing hip hop music on one of the TVs (that's what the tv said...\"hip hop radio\" haha!).\n\nWe ordered their <ptag>sliced lamb potato noodle soup</ptag>, <ptag>cold noodle with sesame</ptag>, and <ptag>spicy potato noodle soup</ptag> and shared them among 4 people. When the <ptag>cold noodles</ptag> came out I was quite disappointed because the only topping it had was cucumber (which, I guess that's understandable since we got the simplest cold noodle in the menu) BUT there was VERY LITTLE cucumber. In fact, all the bowls came with fewer toppings than I'd like. Nonetheless, the food was very good. Soup base was very flavourful (the lamb soup had a strong but not over powering lamb taste), even the cold noodles (which was pretty much just sauce and noodles) was quite savoury and I couldn't stop eating it. Noodles themselves were also good (not soggy, plentiful) and you could see the difference in the noodles (some would have a clear coating around it) but they all tasted the same. We were all very full at the end. I think it's a decent place to get your noodle fix, but the lack of toppings with those prices...makes me wish we went for ramen instead."
"I haven't tried their original location at pacific mall so I can't compare...but overall the food quality and portion was pretty good and good value. I ordered the <ptag>beef brisket potato noodle soup</ptag>. Hubby ordered the <ptag>seafood potato soup</ptag>, there were shrimps and fish balls ..and I don't remember what else. Anyways I was turned off by that order because the shrimp skin wasn't peeled. Come on, the bowl of noodle soup  was so hot, how do you expect us to eat those shrimps?! Atmosphere - We came in on a Thursday evening (7ish) and it was pretty busy, though we got seats for 2 within 3 minutes of waiting. I liked that it was a pretty clean and spacious environment. The vibe was pretty good, a young crowd (I'm pretty old so when I say young I mean above 25 but under 45!). They were playing pretty good (young) music . Btw, this plaza is gettin more busy so be prepared to find parking! Customer service - Ok, so they were quick and food came out within 8 minutes..but I would say they fail on customer service.  Firstly, why were you giving me empty tea cups with no tea pot on the table?? I notice that also happened to the table next to us. Secondly, why isn't there any free wifi. I asked two waiters if they know the password and they said no. Seriously? U need to get with the trend! Lose points there. Lastly, not a big deal, but they just gave us a piece of paper and rudely told us to write down the our order on the paper. Overall - I'll come back again and give it another try someday. I'll order something else and try out one of the side orders probably.."
