"Love coming here when I go to <ntag>Vegas</ntag>. The <ntag>happy hour</ntag> is <ntag>awesome</ntag>! They have featured <ptag>wine</ptag> for $6 (I got the <ntag>sparkling</ntag> that was regularly $15 a glass). We got the sirloin <ptag>sliders</ptag> which looked like the perfect little mini <ptag>burger</ptag>. They were <ntag>awesome</ntag>. The bartenders were also fun yet professional. Their <ptag>wine</ptag> cellar is in the middle of the restaurant and goes all the way up to the second floor and is surrounded by glass so you can see into it. A <ntag>very</ntag> <ntag>classy</ntag> and <ntag>delicious</ntag> place!"
