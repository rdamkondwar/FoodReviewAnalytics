I had the <ptag>Lobster cobb salad</ptag>, <ptag>delmonico rib eye <steak</ptag>, <ptag>mashed potatoes</ptag> and <ptag>onion rings</ptag>. The <ptag>onion ring</ptag> portion is <ntag>large</ntag> to share between 3 to 4 people. <ptag>Lobester cobb salad</ptag> comes with blue cheese. I personally dont like it and find the taste a <ntag>little</ntag> too <ntag>strong</ntag> for the salad dressing. You can ask them not to include it if you are like me who doesnt like blue cheese. Note: this restaurant is exclusive unless you are VIP or season ticket holder you might not even get a table. If you have tickets for a game you can try to reserve a table for the game night."
