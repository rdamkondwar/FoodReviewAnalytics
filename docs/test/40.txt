I was drinking water like a camel in the desert post dim-sum.  No wonder everything tastes so good!\n\nTheir honey-garlic short ribs and tapioca custard crystal \"buns\" were memorable.  I found their shrimp dumpling wrapper to be a bit on the thick side.  I liked that their <ptag>calamari</ptag> was only LIGHTLY battered (almost as if it were grilled) versus most dim sum places that put on a full batter.  \n\nDim sum is about $2 per dish.  \n\nSo with that said, the food was really tasty - but I think I am overhydrated now!"
"Happy Mid-Autumn <ntag>Festival</ntag>!  Perfect night for observing Full Moon.\n\nAs it is a festival day that many Chinese would go out to celebrate with a Family dinner, so did my family.  Nothing too special, it's all about just getting together and sharing some good conversation as a family. It was fully packed but there was people waiting for just a short time at the entrance.  Judging from this point, it wasn't everybody's must-visit spot to celebrate.  It was a large dining area enough for small banquet if necessary but unlikely.  The Chinese name describes \"Farm Family\" style.\n\nBraised Pork Rib in Spicy Pot($10.99) is advertised from a previous competition but take it with a grain of salt.  It was basically <ptag>Pork Bone Soup</ptag> style with Szechuan style whole Red Chili, Radish, Ginger, Scallion.  The Stock was similar to Bak Kut Teh of Singapore fare since it had slight herbal taste.  What I thought would be Pork Rib became Pork Bone(-0.5 Star)\n\nYellow Fin Grouper 2-ways($28.88): <ptag>Stir Fried Grouper</ptag> with Chinese Kale was A-OK, not too salty or sauced but just a smidge overdone.  Black Bean Steam Grouper on Tofu was as normal as it comes.\n\nI'm a bit indifferent at this place as it's not amazing me but not so bad that I can't eat here.  I give it an additional 0.5 *Star* as the waitress came clean out our dishes full of bones and provided extra napkins without any comment from us."
