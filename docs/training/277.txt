"This place was recommended to <ntag>me</ntag> by a few local Yelpers. So after arriving a day early for a business trip, my coworker and I stopped here for a few <ptag>beers</ptag> and a late lunch.The place is interesting with a long bar, high top table seating as well as regular sized table seating, a mid-century modern corner seating area and a large outdoor patio with plenty of additional seating.The <ptag>beer</ptag> menu is on a chalkboard above the bar. I had two dark <ptag>beers</ptag> while I was <ntag>here</ntag> which were good but I was really craving a sour which they did not have any on tap. Oh well.For lunch, my coworker and I both ordered the <ptag>Matador sandwich</ptag> which was covered with <ptag>beef</ptag> and a side order of <ptag>fries</ptag>. The <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was <ntag>great</ntag> and beautifully presented. The one criticism is the <ptag>pretzel roll</ptag> was a bit <ntag>dry</ntag>. The <ptag>fries</ptag> were <ntag>good</ntag> also and the ketchup was <ntag>amazing</ntag>. Really enjoyed the place and talking to our server. But still would have liked to see a sour on the <ptag>beer</ptag> menu. Apparently sours aren't as popular yet in <ntag>Phoenix</ntag> as the rest of the <ntag>country</ntag>."
