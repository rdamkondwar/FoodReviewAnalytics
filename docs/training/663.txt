"This place was sooo much <ntag>better</ntag> than <ntag>Pho Hung</ntag>. The food was at <ntag>delicious</ntag> and the service was <ntag>speedy</ntag> and considerate. The owners made us feel very welcomed and even joked with us the entire time we were there. We ordered a bunch of <ptag>rice</ptag> combos and guess what? They give you a side <ptag>soup</ptag> with the <ptag>rice</ptag> combos! Which is a plus because back in the states, finding a viet place that automatically give you a side <ptag>soup</ptag> with your <ptag>rice</ptag> is VERY rare. They always do it the half ass way. However at <ntag>Bun Saigon</ntag>, they do it the way things are supposed to be done. everything about each portion that my family and I ordered were <ntag>perfect</ntag>. They gave moderate, considerable amounts of food, the right portionality, and the right sides that is culturally correct for each meal. I would definitely be back to this place whenever I visit from the states again."
