The comic book section is </ntag>crazy</ntag>, not organized and books are not bagged or boarded. But <ntag>crazy</ntag> can be fun, hunting for issues that you might be missing from your collection or finding something new that interests you. At .50 a book who can beat that, although do not expect to find mint or nm books since most have been shuffled through, opened, and carelessly handled, but still enjoyed trying to find something that might be a treasure in this haystack."
