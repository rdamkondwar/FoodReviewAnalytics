"5/5 for <ptag>beer</ptag> selection, 3/5 for food - 4/5 for ambience .....<ntag>Awesome</ntag> <ntag>Biergarten</ntag> feel.!I thought the previous reviewers misjudged the food a bit - but I completely agree now.Had the <ptag>schnitzel</ptag> & a half liter of HB.. Kids had the <ptag>schnitzel fingers</ptag> & <ptag>fries</ptag>, wife enjoyed a <ptag>pretzel</ptag>... IMHO - the gravy <ntag>served with</ntag> the <ptag>schnitzel</ptag> is....  Umm.   Meh....   Bring in a <ptag>mushroom</ptag> / jaeger style <ntag>sauce</ntag> & it would jump...  WAY up in flavor...  And it would compliment the <ptag>hot potato salad</ptag> immeasurably..   (Well, that's an exaggeration - I'd bump it one full star for sure...).  I do plan to return. Gotta get that 5 star combo....  :)"
