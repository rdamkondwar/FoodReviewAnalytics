"Stopped in today for lunch, I ordered a whole Italian <ptag>hoagie</ptag> and a <ptag>coke</ptag>. The total was less than $10. The <ptag>sub</ptag> was <ntag>good</ntag>, <ntag>plenty</ntag> of <ptag>meat</ptag> and toppings. They let you put on your own Italian dressing, which is good because some places think the <ntag>flavor</ntag> needs to come from the dressing and not the <ptag>meats</ptag>. I disagree, I don't want them swimming in the </ntag>sauce<ntag>! It was toasted and still <ntag>soft</ntag> enough to where I didn't cut up the roof of my mouth. I will definitely be back and try out their <ptag>pizza</ptag> because it looked <ntag>great</ntag>!"
