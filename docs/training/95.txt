"Visiting from So. Cal.  I had the <ptag>spinach mushroom omelette</ptag> and my wife had the <ntag>wild</ntag> <ptag>mushroom</ptag> <ptag>frittata</ptag>. Prepared very nicely and did not skimp on ingredients. We also shared a bowl of green <ptag>chili chicken soup</ptag>. EXCELLENT!!  Vivianna was our server. Very <ntag>personable</ntag> and attentive. WELL DONE!!!"
"It's not fancy but it is <ntag>good</ntag>. The <ptag>Egg</ptag> I Am is under new management. They have kept the same menu but have tweaked it a bit.  One things that is <ntag>great</ntag> and better than expected is the kale cooler which is a <ptag>juice</ptag> drink.  Very refreshing.  I can't wait to <ntag>try</ntag> the <ptag>pineapple</ptag> tonic. The breakfasts are <ntag>terrific</ntag> with artfully prepared <ptag>egg</ptag> dishes and <ntag>GOOD</ntag> <ptag>pancakes</ptag>. <ntag>Their</ntag> <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> are carefully <ntag>prepared</ntag>. I urge anyone who would like to <ntag>try</ntag> it or try it again....please do not hesitate."
"Our family just moved to <ntag>Scottsdale</ntag> from Chicago and we absolutely fell in love with this <ntag>place</ntag>. The service is always <ntag>great</ntag>, people are so friendly. The food is VERY good and they have <ntag>great</ntag> healthy options as well. Someone previously commented it is comparable to IHOP? I couldn't disagree more. <ntag>I</ntag> have had so many different meals and its always <ntag>great</ntag>. Their prices are reasonable as well. They also have kid options - always a plus especially for us with a 5 year old. Try their new <ptag>pumpkin pecan waffle</ptag> that they only offer during the fall - it is to die for! Try this place, <ntag>you</ntag> wont regret it!"
