It is the lowest quality they can get and sell. :( so sad! Bc it was my lunch.. Can't leave work again. Threw this bowl away! Guess that's what you get for $5.68! China a NO NO!! Never again will I return! Same with my fo workers who ordered the <ptag>wonton soup</ptag>! The <ptag>shrimp</ptag> was cut up! No <ptag>cabbage</ptag> or other <ptag>wonton soup</ptag> norms!"
"This was my first visit to a China a Go Go location. I have heard <ntag>good</ntag> things about this place by friends and have been excited to check it out. I came here for lunch with a coworker. We ordered some <ptag>pot stickers</ptag> and the <ptag>eggplant and tofu entree</ptag>. Our food came with <ptag>egg drop soup</ptag>. The portions were <ntag>enormous</ntag>. The two of us were able to share the entree and still had about half left to take home as leftovers. The food was prepared <ntag>quickly</ntag> and was extremely fresh for a fast food type of restaurant. The prices are also fantastic. I'll definitely be frequenting this location for lunch more often!"
"Wow! China Go Go does not splurge on their portions. I felt like I ate half a family dinner. Not a lunch special (served to 4 PM.).  China Go Go features two price ranges for lunch specials. $5.95 and $6.25 for <ptag>shrimp</ptag> based entries. Personally, I prefer the pepper <ptag>steak</ptag>, <ptag>shrimp chop suey</ptag>, and <ptag>shrimp</ptag> with lobster <ntag>sauce</ntag>.  This is the typical China Go Go experience. Upon ordering from the menu, you pay. If you are drinking a cola, <ntag>you</ntag> pick up a cup and serve your self at the cola fountain. The server will deliver your food and plastic utensils. If you are happy with your service, there is a tip jar at the counter.  The lunch special started with <ptag>noodles</ptag> and duck sauce. I enjoy thick <ptag>noodles</ptag>.  Then, they served me the <ptag>soup</ptag> of the day: <ptag>egg drop soup</ptag>. This has been the <ptag>soup</ptag> of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as <ptag>won ton</ptag> or <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag>.  Finally, they served my entree: <ptag>shrimp chop suey</ptag> with <ptag>fried rice</ptag> and <ptag>chow mien</ptag>. The portion could feed two people. The <ptag>shrimps</ptag> were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the <ptag>broccoli</ptag> and <ptag>mushrooms</ptag>, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The <ptag>fried rice</ptag> was your average <ptag>fried rice</ptag>. I am not crazy over the <ptag>chow mien</ptag>. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's <ptag>Chow Mien</ptag>. As I said, China Go Go gives a lot for a lunch special. However, <ntag>large</ntag> portions do not guarantee a five star review. I would be a fan if they change their <ptag>soup</ptag> of the day or add <ptag>won ton soup</ptag> at a reasonable charge, and improve their <ptag>chow mien</ptag>, which is served with the meal. I give China Go Go 3 1/2 stars, which is good. Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is <ntag>great</ntag> on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review."
"I haven't been to any of the China a Go Go locations in <ntag>a</ntag> couple years, but we decided to go here last week for dinner. We ordered Family Dinner A - $25.95 which came with 2 <ptag>Egg Rolls</ptag> and 2 <ptag>Crab Rangoons</ptag>, <ptag>soup</ptag> (Egg Flower), <ptag>rice</ptag> and two entrees (Orange <ptag>Chicken</ptag> & <ptag>Beef Broccoli</ptag>). It was more than enough for two people. In fact, it was enough for our dinner that night AND lunch the next day. The food pretty much tasted like most of the other Chinese fast food joints. My favorites were probably the <ptag>BBQ Pork fried rice</ptag> and <ptag>Egg Flower soup</ptag>; both very satisfying. The staff were all very friendly and <ntag>attentive</ntag>. We dined in, so they kept refilling our glasses and making sure we were doing alright. This location definitely has much better service than a couple other China a Go Go locations I've been to."
