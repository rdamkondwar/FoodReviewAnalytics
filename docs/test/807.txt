"We were <ntag>staying</ntag> at the <ntag>Mandarin Oriental</ntag>, so decided to give the restaurant a try.  A bit disappointed that we were not able to order <ptag>dim sum</ptag>, as it was only available for dinner.  So we ordered a <ptag>California Roll</ptag> and a <ptag>Tuna Roll</ptag> which were <ntag>very tasty</ntag> and <ntag>light</ntag> and prepared with <ntag>fresh</ntag> ingredients.  I had the <ptag>soup du jour</ptag> - cream of mushroom - also very good.  My husband had the <ptag>caesar salad</ptag> - <ntag>scrumptious</ntag>.  A bit pricey for everything, but this is Vegas.  Restaurant itself is rather small with minimal ambience, but <ntag>good service</ntag> and <ntag>very pleasant</ntag> staff.  Would have liked to try dinner menu, but that night they were <ntag>filled</ntag> up, so maybe next time we are in <ntag>Vegas</ntag>!"
