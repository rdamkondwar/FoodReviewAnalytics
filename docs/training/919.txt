"Nice new lil spot located downtown. It has free parking which is great for after our drinks and being downtown. \n\nThe night we went they had both drink and appetizer specials. I'm all about a food special. I got spinach dip and a flatbread pizza. Between the two the flatbread pizza was the best. It was regular mozzarella and marinara pizza, cooked to perfection, not overdone. I also had a cosmopolitan drink special. It was very strong and sweet. Our waitress was extremely friendly and very personable, checking on us multiple times to see if we needed anything. The night that we went they had karaoke. Even though it wasn't extremely crowded a few people went up there which was nice. Even the restaurant manager got on the mic to do karaoke. I thought that was a nice touch to get the patrons involved. The location is a little bit out of the center of uptown, so I hope this is a spot that can stick around. They aren't open for lunch so that changes things a little, but I would go again for a ladies night or after work drinks."
"Friday late night (7/22/2016) was my 1st time out to Sydney's. This was such a fun wine/martini bar! I went with a group of friends to hear a mutual friend sing, and her performance was the highlight of the evening. Their <ptag>martini</ptag> list is extensive, however, when I switched over to beer, it took 3 orders for me to get a beer selection (no Stella, and no Mich Ultra even though it was on the menu). Before my husband switched over the beer, he had 1 vodka/sprite, and 2 kamikaze shots, which totaled $30.00! Ouch! Wasn't expecting that! Our waitress Jackie was outstanding; attentive and prompt and very friendly. The place is intimate enough to have conversations, but big enough to move around. We will definitely be back again!"
"Nice place to have a drink but the servers were a little slow but once they got going it was on.  Good place for couples or singles to mingle.  The food is microwaved and awful. The pizza was a school lunch pizza and the chicken nachos were just chicken pieces over some nacho chips with melted cheese in the microwave.  It was <ntag>gross</ntag>. But the drinks are great."
"Food was amazing , atmosphere was amazing, and <ntag>jazz</ntag> musician was amazing. My favorite meal was the traditional cheese and pepperoni flatbread. I highly recommend this place for a date night. Older mature crowd, but great for young professionals!!"
"Nice location and they validate parking after 5pm and on Saturdays. They have an extensive martini menu and a good wine list. There are a limited number of appetizers, but I tried to the chicken spinach flat bread and the spinach dip which were really good. The night I went they had a Jazz band playing. Overall I would go back to Sydney's not sure if they offer any drink specials as our waitress didn't mention any and I didn't ask. The martini I had was 11 bucks but it was pretty big."
"Sydney's is located where Therapy Martini Bar used to be and, unfortunately, has the same dilemma after Therapy killed their great idea: expansion created way too much space in a stretched out design.  It just doesn't function well as an intimate, hip place.  Finding the bathrooms almost requires a map especially after a couple <ntag>libations</ntag>! Our service was good and our waitress was very friendly.  I think she lacked training since she struggled with basic service skills.  The good news is she has a winning personality well suited for success.\n\nOn the night we went they had live music and 1/2 price wine by the glass.  Nice.  The music was excellent but our friends thought it too loud (which is part of the problem with the <ntag>layout</ntag>).  The downer was the basic barfood trying to act grown up.  It didn't work.  Their <ntag>entire menu needs</ntag> a complete rework for what they are attempting.  Our flat bread appeared to be a frozen entree from Trader Joe's and the Buffalo chicken queso reminded us of reheated jarred cheese from the grocery store with a handful of tortilla chips straight from the bag.  Quantity was small--just enough for one--and price was $10 each (during happy hour).  \n\nWe realize this location is a tough gig, and we are all hoping the new high-rise apartments on 11th will improve traffic.  In the meantime, Sydney's has to step up their game."
