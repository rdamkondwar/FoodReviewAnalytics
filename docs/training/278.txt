"Epic BBQ at <ntag>Lattuca</ntag>! Straight up <ptag>meat</ptag> (plus sides) so there's no menu, server just tells you what's available. <ntag>Minimal</ntag> drinks (some <ptag>beers</ptag>, <ptag>wines</ptag>, etc) but the focus is obviously on the <ptag>meat</ptag>. Our party of 4 had the resurrection with <ptag>beef ribs</ptag>, <ptag>pork ribs</ptag>, <ptag>brisket</ptag>, and <ptag>pulled pork</ptag>.Lattuca is known for his award-winning <ptag>brisket</ptag> and it did not <ntag>disappoint</ntag>. It melted in your mouth. The <ptag>ribs</ptag> literally fell off the bone. <ptag>Pulled pork</ptag> was <ntag>great<n/tag> as well.The owner is passionate about BBQ and that can be tasted in <ntag>the</ntag> food. There's not a lot of tables and it filled up very quickly, so reservations are highly <ntag>recommended</ntag>."
"Calling y'all fellow Texans and Barbecue lovers. If you find yourself needing a barbecue fix in Montreal, Quebec (yeah I said Montreal Canada) then Lattuca Barbecue is the place to go.  Being a fellow Texan I won't be ashamed recommending the place to my family and friends.  Owner/Chef John Lattuca is spreading the barbecue philosophy to Montreal.  Definitely try the three <ptag>meat</ptag> combo.  It's all about the <ptag>beef</ptag> at <ntag>Lattuca</ntag> Barbecue."
"Really fantastic barbecue (and that's coming from someone who lived in <ntag>Texas</ntag> for 7 years, and is married to a KC barbecue snob). The <ptag>brisket</ptag> was delicious - perfectly smoked, with <ntag>creamy</ntag> fat and <ntag>great</ntag> flavor. The <ptag>pulled pork</ptag> was also excellent - nicely flavored, and still <ntag>juicy</ntag>. The <ptag>Mac & cheese</ptag> was <ntag>tasty</ntag>, but I liked the <ptag>coleslaw</ptag> best. It's a vinegar based slaw, so it's a perfect counterpoint to the barbecue. If you're in Montreal, you'll be missing out if you don't come here."
