"We went to <ntag>Yatai</ntag> last night for <ntag>dinner</ntag> and came away <ntag>very happy</ntag>. Oddly enough, we were the only people in the entire restaurant. I think the location may be a sticking point for <ntag>Yatai</ntag> but I would definitely encourage people to stop by and give them a try.The <ptag>steak</ptag> skewers were yummy, the <ptag>scallops</ptag> were very <ntag>good</ntag>, the <ptag>chicken hearts</ptag> were overcooked and chewy, the <ptag>calamari</ptag> was <ntag>great</ntag>, <ptag>mushrooms</ptag> were good and the <ptag>shrimp tempura</ptag> was good as well.The customer service was <ntag>excellent</ntag>. Our waitress was <ntag>very polite</ntag>, prompt and we were even brought a free <ptag>mango drink</ptag> to try, which was <ntag>really yummy</ntag>."
