"This place has made me so sad.We started going a year ago after they first opened.Their stuff was <ntag>fabulous</ntag> - cheap, <ntag>fresh</ntag>, full of guacamole, <ptag>tomatoes</ptag>, fresh herbs, etc.The service was always <ntag>terrible</ntag> - the same very overwhelmed woman at the cash and just one guy in back who takes 15-30 minutes EVERY SINGLE TIME to <ntag>make</ntag> a <ptag>taco</ptag>. But the food we got made that forgivable.Fast forward one year later - we went tonight and got an order to take out.We got home and found they screwed up the order and gave us 2 <ptag>steak</ptag> instead of 1 <ptag>steak</ptag>, 1 <ptag>chicken</ptag>.   On both orders there was: 1.  Zero guacamole.2.  Zero fresh vegetables.3.  Spicy, VERY  overcooked <ptag>meat</ptag> that has had a ton of packaged seasoning added to it.4.  Higher prices than only 1 year ago.5.  Instead of a ton of fresh herbs there were just a few <ntag>dried</ntag> out flakes on top.This is <ntag>not</ntag> the same product they put out just a few short months ago.What we got completely turned us off from a place we've enjoyed about 10 times, and honestly it's just sad  :-("
"These <ptag>tacos</ptag> are <ntag>delicious</ntag> and huge! Each one has enough topping for about 4 <ptag>tacos</ptag>. Seriously. The <ptag>steak</ptag> was lean and soft, the veggie <ptag>taco</ptag> was full of refried <ptag>beans</ptag>, <ptag>onions</ptag>, <ptag>salad</ptag>, cream and cilantro. Each <ptag>taco</ptag> comes with two <ptag>tortillas</ptag>, but they were almost impossible to <ntag>pick</ntag> up. Two <ptag>tacos</ptag> filled me to the brim! Absolutely satisfying and amazing value at $4.35 each. Tiny place full of people. Friendly fast service. Definitely a winner!"
