"Reading older reviews can be so confusing sometimes. I came in expecting great <ntag>lebanese cuisine</ntag> similar to what I've experienced elsewhere in Montreal or perhaps even better but ultimately we left quite underwhelmed. Our dining experience : <ptag>Fattouch salad</ptag> - Decent but completely lacked the zest a fattouch salad should have. Also was the pita fried? I much prefer it being baked and with the salad dressing it was quite soggy instead of crunchy. This is a different take to the traditional salad. Feuillte : The cheese was perfect, very yummy. Probably the best thing we ate. <ptag>Falafel</ptag> - Decent but felt it was fried a bit too long thus making it crunchier than expected. Meat Leaves : They were very dry and thus not good at all.<ptag>Meat Plate</ptag> - The variety of meats were good, with the filet mignon being the best. Chicken was decent. Kebbe was decent. Why just one stick? Shrimp decent. Garlic was way off, wayyyyy too much garlic, no flavor. Fries were good. Katayef : Was good but filling was economic.Lebanese coffee : Was good but was served over 20 minutes after our dessert? Also we got enough coffee in our pot for 6+ people! We were only 3! <ntag> Service</ntag> was decent but they need to ensure courses are served at the same time. Coffee needs to go with dessert. Price-tag is very high and not good value. Our meal for 4 was $150 + tip. We had much better elsewhere for under $125 with tip. Maybe they were better in the past? Either way on a Saturday night it was about 1/3 full. This was a clue I think. 2.5 Stars rounded down."
