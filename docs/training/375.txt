"This is one of those, you get what you pay for situations. I'll admit, all I ordered was the won-ton soup & it wasn't bad but it wasn't worth making the out of the way trip for either. The <ntag>woman</ntag> behind the counter is definitely not friendly but my food was hot , and <ntag>fresh</ntag> so I really can't complain."
"I've been going to Ming Cheng since the mid-90s, and it's barely changed in that time.  I've rarely ventured from my standards because every time I've ordered something different I haven't liked it as much.  Pork lo mein, pork fried rice, egg rolls, and wonton soup can't be beat (just get the combo).  The fried wontons are worth an extra hour at the gym the next day.  A friend swears by the pork egg foo yung (with pork fried rice of course).  They're not heavy-handed with the soy sauce, and you can often see someone cutting up fresh vegetables and meat at the back of kitchen.  With that, it is what it is - it's a strip mall Chinese take-out place.  Portions are very generous, prices are low, ingredients are fresh, flavors have been consistent for a long time even with new cooks rotating in and out.  No, the owner isn't friendly, but she keeps the cooks on task and gets you your food quickly and correctly"
