"Went here for <ptag>chicken souvalki</ptag> on a pita with a coworker during the week - take out. For the price, there could have been bigger pieces of <ptag>chicken</ptag>. It wasn't the <ntag>best</ntag> <ntag>Greek food</ntag> I've had or the worst - I guess <ntag>mediocre</ntag> would describe it best. In a pinch it will satisfy your <ntag>Greek food</ntag> craving but I wouldn't make a <ntag>special</ntag> trip."
