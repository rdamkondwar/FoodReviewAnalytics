Here to fill the void is Peixoto (pay-SHOW-toe) <ptag>Coffee</ptag> - a little family owned, locally roasted cafe. My only complaint is the cramped sitting area, I didn't find it very comfortable to engage in my studies. However if you plan on putting your MacBook away for five seconds and maybe reading one of those paper things, I absolutely recommend this <ntag>place</ntag>. Not only can one expect the favorites-- you know, your lattes and Americanos, Peixoto also has few tricks up their sleeves. Taking the cold brew baton and passing it to its fresher, sparklier, nitrogenated cousin, they are sure to have every weebly blogging iphonographer from here to 7th and Mcdowell riding their fixed gears down to Peixoto to taste this delectable nectar. But! Not only have they taken the best of coffee and the best of craft beer and combined them into the most refreshing cup of coffee imaginable, they've also managed to craft some hocus pocus over tea and coffee and turn them into the same thing! What kind of quantum tomfoolery is going on behind that bar?! I tip my hat to you Peixoto, you mad scientists, you've upped the game just a little bit, and right in the sweet heart of the 4-8-0 too. Homie dis chandluh."
"Small coffee shop in the heart of downtown Chandler. I went in today with my best friend because we been wanting to find a place who does latte art. This is the place that actually does the art!!! We went in about 7 am and the young gentlemen taking our orders was very helpful. I'm not <ptag>coffee</ptag> savy so I was glad to learn and try something new.  The latte art he said we could pick what design we wanted or leave it up to the barista. I know it's not easy so we let it be a surprise. We order a <ptag>decaf latte</ptag> and <ptag>cappuccino</ptag>. \n\n***The only thing they don't have is a variety of baked goods on display. They only had some toaster strudels on display and when we asked the young gentlemen names us some 3 choices of breads they had in the back. We ordered a banana bread. Drinks we strong (I added more sugar on mine) and bread was delicious.  Overall great experience."
