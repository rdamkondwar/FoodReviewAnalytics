"Honestly, grocery store owners should travel in tandem to Wegman's in <ntag>Buffalo</ntag> (see my review) to see how it should be done.  Take a hint:  clean up your entrance way, clean up your sign (you are missing a letter) and get rid of the flies in <ntag>the</ntag> <ptag>bread</ptag> department.  The downtrodden atmosphere is heightened by a security guard who meanders by to ensure that I'm really parking and shopping and not taking classes at nearby Seneca College.   After my shopping experience here I sang, meh, meh, meh all the way home."
"This store is now Richard's No Frills.  Once again, flyer items were <ntag>unavailable</ntag> on the first day of the sale.  Spoke to owner who said that while he ordered, this particular supplier failed to <ntag>deliver</ntag>.  Really?  What about last week and the week before that?  Owner just cannot get his act together. Shopper's Drug Mart appeared and then disappeared from list of stores included.  Their shelves are sometimes empty of staple items like <ptag>bread</ptag> and <ptag>milk</ptag>.  With the exception of some cashiers, the staff is not helpful and provides inaccurate information."
