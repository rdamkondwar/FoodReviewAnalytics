"<ntag>Great</ntag> service and the food is the same as I have experienced in Central America --light, not so spicy, and varied in texture. We had a very <ntag>helpful</ntag> man suggest items from the menu. I strongly recommend the <ptag>fruit drink</ptag> with chunks of fruit (in the picture). And they have <ptag>pupusas</ptag> that are <ntag>really</ntag> <ntag>good</ntag> with <ntag>fresh</ntag> <ptag>coleslaw</ptag>. Try this as an appetizer. The <ptag>tortillas</ptag> are not what you might be used to --they are about 5 in diameter and thick like a <ptag>pancake</ptag>. But they are made <ntag>fresh</ntag> and are <ntag>really</ntag> <ntag>nice</ntag>. My companion had the aroz valenciana which was tasty and I had the Elianas favorite which was grilled <ptag>chicken</ptag> with that terrific latin american creme cheese. Mmmmmm... cheese! The service was consistent and friendly and the food was tasty and a nice break from all the Mexican joints in the area."
