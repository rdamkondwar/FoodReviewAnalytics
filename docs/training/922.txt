"This place is a must-visit if you are staying in Vegas for a few days. It's a short walk to a Gordon Biersch, so you can knock both out in one visit. \n\nTotal wine is a huge store. Most of it is dedicated to wine and spirits. The <ptag>craft beer</ptag> is mostly confined to one aisle on the far right of the store. Lots of good stuff, and an emphasis on the big brews. Great DIPA selection when I went. I picked up a North Coast Sochai Old Stock, Hop Henge, Firestone Union Jack, and a few other bottles. Had a huge supply of Rouge Bacon Maple too."
"This place is amazing. It's a liquor <ntag>wonderland</ntag>! It's easy to locate in Boca Park (on the north end facing Tivoli Village) and has a lot of parking. Grab a cart or basket (get the cart, trust me) and spend some time to browse the well-stocked shelves. My first visit was late last year because I wanted to find new craft beers for Ruben. There is no shortage of craft beers. There's an entire aisle dedicated to it. I mean, WOW. The best part? You can buy it by the bottle! There are additional beer aisles offering packs, cases, and kegs. Anyway, the important thing is that their selection is impressive. I've been able to find several beers that I've been searching for and many, many others I didn't know about previously. \n\nI've only purchased liquor once and it was Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel. This is a limited release and I was pleased to find it available at this location for a good price. It was relatively easy to find too.\n\nAn additional perk of shopping Total Wine is their website. You can choose your shopping location and it allows you access to their inventory! It also gives you the option to shop online and pick up at the store within 24 hours. I believe there's a quicker option if you need your selection in a hurry. The shop and pick-up option is so convenient if you don't have time to wander around the store.\n\nOh, when you purchase several bottles, they reuse one of their many liquor boxes for easy travel! They will help you to the car if necessary too.\n\nBonus: FREE chilling service!"
"Hands down, no better warehouse of booze to be found on this earth!  \n\nSure, it might be hard to possibly find an employee to answer a question or assist from time to time, but if this is the only hiccup, it is minimal in my experience.  \n\nTotal Wine is located all across the country.  I am glad we have it here in Vegas.  It is a one stop shop for all liquor, wine, beer.  This sentiment actually does not do Total Wine justice.  Wine classes, cigars, bar ware... The list goes on.  \n\nI go because I am a wine drinker and seek out Pinots.  With this one varietal, I could spend the whole day just perusing with my Vivino Ap and an adventuresome spirit.  They have such an extensive collection and the  widest selection you will find in Las Vegas."
"This is an incredible liquor store.  Overall, it is absolutely one of the best to which I have ever been.  The spirit/mixer selection is large and varied, with some unusual or hard-to-find items.  The <ptag>beer</ptag> selection is incredible - overall I have only seen its equal in a few places, none in Las Vegas.  They sell everything also by the individual bottle if you want, which is very nice.  The selection of imported <ptag>beers</ptag> - especially British and German - is particularly nice as is the selection of craft or small brewery beers from the US, with some Mid-West or East-Coast ones I haven't seen elsewhere in the west."
"This store is so much fun. Seriously, I don't think I've ever had so much fun shopping for beer and wine.  <ntag>Shoes</ntag>, <ntag>handbags</ntag>, <ntag>dresses</ntag>, yes.  \n\nI spent an hour perusing the craft beers, didn't even notice until I heard customers laughing and clinking that there was a wine tasting going on.  My friend issued me a challenge:  Can you get out of there for under a $100?  It was a challenge in jest because there is no such store in L.A., so she always stocks up.\n\nAs we were narrowing down our choices in the cart, a salesperson comes over to ask, May I Help You?  The four most dangerous words in that store.  Instead of helping your pare down your basket, they are making these recommendations.  Their favorites.  The wines with their pictures next to.  They don't just put their lips on it, they put their mugs on it!\n\nThe store also offers snacks galore, limes, decanters, glasses -- you name it.  \n\nSo we did some very early holiday shopping.  Caution, not all the prices are the best.  Some of our favorites were actually priced higher here than in L.A.  \n\nAnd as we headed to the parking lot, we overheard some women say, \"there's no more room left in the car!\"  One woman wore a T-shirt that said, \"You look like you need a drink.\""
