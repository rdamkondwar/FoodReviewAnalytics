"<ntag>Great</ntag> Staff.<ntag>Fresh</ntag> Ingredients.Quite possibly the <ntag>best</ntag> <ptag>pizza</ptag> I have ever had. (I've eaten <ptag>pizza</ptag> all over!)The sauce is sweeter then I normally like, but it is still so <ntag>good</ntag>, with lot's of <ntag>fresh</ntag> <ptag>basil</ptag>.Oddly, they even have pretty good <ptag>espresso</ptag>."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the <ptag>pizza</ptag> here. <ptag>Pizza</ptag> by the (huge) slice runs about $3-4.  I had the <ptag>pepperoni</ptag>,  <ptag>prosciutto</ptag>, and <ptag>tomato</ptag> combo. The crust was <ntag>crisp</ntag> except for the end which was a bit <ptag>bready</ptag> and not very <ntag>brown</ntag> but still <ntag>good</ntag> (I like the crust).  I also liked how they use <ntag>fresh</ntag> mozzarella which made for a different (less greasy) cheese texture than what you would normally find at other places. There were <ntag>plenty</ntag> of vegetarian options as well as a non-cheese option available. Overall, a nice place that I know I'll visiting again."
