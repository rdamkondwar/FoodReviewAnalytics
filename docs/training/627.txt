"There are several <ntag>Jimmy Johns</ntag> downtown.  This is a new location.  It is <ntag>fairly</ntag> crowded at lunch.  Good variety of <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> to choose from on <ptag>french bread</ptag>.  <ntag>Sides</ntag> consist of <ptag>Chips</ptag> or Giant <ptag>cookies</ptag>.  I'm a fan of the JJ Gargantuan.  It consists of a little of everything.  It is huge!"
"Freaky fast!Ok so I enjoy <ntag>Jimmy John's</ntag> the food is <ntag>good</ntag> and a <ntag>great</ntag> quality. As far as <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> go you can find <ntag>cheaper</ntag> but the <ntag>fresh</ntag> ingredients here are worth the cost. It's all about the <ptag>bread</ptag> and if you go in grab a 50 cent day old loaf for the road. With that <ptag>bread</ptag> as your <ptag>sandwich</ptag> canvas you cannot go wrong in your own <ptag>sandwich</ptag> creations."
