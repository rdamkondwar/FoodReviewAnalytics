"Of all the chain <ptag>sandwich</ptag> places <ntag>Jimmy John's</ntag> is my favorite!  It might hold a special place in my heart partly because <ntag>Jimmy John's</ntag> originated  in <ntag>Charleston</ntag>, IL 30 minutes from my home town...  But <ntag>really</ntag> I just love their chewy <ptag>french bread</ptag> and finely cut <ptag>meats</ptag>.  The <ptag>chips</ptag> they have are kettle cooked style and crunchy delicious, and their <ptag>cookies</ptag> are quite tasty as well.  You really can't go wrong with their food.This <ntag>Jimmy John's</ntag> location is new-looking and <ntag>extremely clean</ntag>.  The employees are friendly, and as promised, they had my <ptag>sandwich</ptag> ready so <ntag>fast</ntag> I almost freaked.  I'm <ntag>glad</ntag> I don't live near this <ntag>Jimmy John's</ntag> because I would be tempted to eat here every day."
