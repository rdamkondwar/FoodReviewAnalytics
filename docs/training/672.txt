Except for this one. This looks like the <ntag>stereotypical</ntag> store that always gets robbed. There are bars on the windows so nobody breaks in to steal any of the <ntag>Four Loko</ntag> on sale here.This is a convenience store that sells <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> after they sell <ntag>cigarettes</ntag>, <ntag>lotto tickets</ntag>, and 40s. No seating here, sadly.I would give this place a more favorable rating if their food was at least adequate, but it's not. I got a $2.99 <ptag>gyro</ptag> for lunch. Great price for a large <ptag>gyro</ptag>. However, they used <ptag>cucumber</ptag> sauce instead of the traditional tzatziki sauce, which does have <ptag>cucumbers</ptag> but is <ptag>yogurt</ptag>-based instead of <ptag>cucumber</ptag>-based. It would be an otherwise great lunch if they wouldn't have used the <ptag>cucumber</ptag> sauce. The meat was <ntag>juicy</ntag> and the veggies were <ntag>fresh</ntag>, but it was like I was eating that with ranch dressing. Absolutely ruined it.Never. Again."
