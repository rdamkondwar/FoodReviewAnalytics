# TEXT DOCUMENTS Containing marked entities
We have tagged 300+ text documents (containig top reviews of different restaurants). In each document we have tagged various instances of food and drink items like beer, coffee, burger(s), sushi etc. Such entities have been tagged by enclosing them within \<ptag> and \</ptag> tags. Also, as per the project specifications we have tagged negative examples by enclosing eny word which is not a food item within \<ntag> and \</ntag> tags.
