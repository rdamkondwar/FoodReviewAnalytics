"We came here after dinner while out celebrating our anniversary.  Since we were <ntag>already</ntag> in <ntag>Lawrenceville</ntag> for dinner it seemed an appropriate time to do a little bar hoping since I am noticing Larry-ville seems to <ntag>be</ntag> turning into the new Southside.  There was a lot going on here, and none of it was enticed me to stay past one quick drink.  Before even walking in you could tell the place was booming.  Lots of 20 something's, loud music, and general hoochieness.  We went to the bar, and was approached by the bartender quickly if not overly friendly.  I asked for a drink menu, she hands me one and steps back.  I noticed the menu is so <ntag>sticky</ntag> it really disgusted me, but I soon came to find everything was sticky from the floors to the bar and most likely the other patrons.  I ordered a cocktail, the Gold Fashioned, a play on an Old Fashioned.  It was ok, would have been nice to have a little more bourbon and a little less simple syrup.  Speaking of syrup did some disgruntled worker mop the floor and bar with it.  Gross.  I had to use the restroom but decided to <ntag>hold</ntag> it until the next stop fearing what state that may be in.  Cashed out and split. <ntag>They</ntag> get two stars one for being on the cheaper side of life, Craft <ptag>beer</ptag> and mixed drink $11 and change, and no wait with the service."
"Good food in <ntag>Lawrenceville</ntag> isn't hard to find. There's a new amazing place, all the way down past the hubbub of central Lawrenceville that caught my attention; The GoldMark. For a bar that is trying to make a name for themselves in <ntag>the</ntag> food world, they sure have made their mark. (pun totally intended) My date and I stopped in <ntag>on</ntag> the very first day that the kitchen was open. We decided to <ntag>order</ntag> a few things and fight amongst ourselves for dinner. The order came to <ntag>one</ntag> <ptag>Chicken & Waffles sandwich</ptag>, one GoldMark Cuban, (I love the play on words) and the <ptag>Mac & Cheese</ptag>. Yowza. All the food! For $26, it was quite the steal. The <ptag>Chicken & Waffles sandwich</ptag> is made with a perfectly <ntag>fluffy</ntag> <ptag>waffle</ptag>; just a little sweet. The <ptag>chicken thigh</ptag> was fried and crisp, and the jalape\u00f1o/honey drizzle goodness was <ntag>just</ntag> right to top. It wouldn't be Pittsburgh if they didn't put coleslaw on it. This was just the right addition to <ntag>pull</ntag> the whole <ptag>sandwich</ptag> together. I'd like to go on record and say that I've never had a Cuban. However, this was a great first experience!! They use local rolls, and press braised <ptag>pork</ptag>, honey <ptag>ham</ptag>, house made pickles, swiss <ptag>cheese</ptag>, and a <ptag>lemon aioli</ptag> between them for an amazing first-bite (and every bite thereafter) experience. I'm not a pickle fan; but I loved these! I can't forget the <ptag>Mac & Cheese</ptag>. They make their cheese <ntag>sauce</ntag> in house (no cutting corners here), and then top it with Fritos. FRITOS. Yes, you read that right. It was a little slice of <ntag>heaven</ntag>. I can't speak to the bar; because we were just here for the noms tonight, but their <ptag>Beer</ptag> & Shot tiers seemed pretty popular at the bar. They have a DJ every night that they're  open, good old-school guys spinning on vinyl, hence the name The GoldMark. I'll totally be back to eat the other half of the menu and more! Happy Eating!"
