"<ptag>Garlic Steak Salad</ptag> with Balsamic Dressing and a <ptag>peach smoothie</ptag> were both <ntag>terrific</ntag>. Only in <ntag>town</ntag> for a few days but will be back in the morning to try their breakfast."
"I had a very good experience with this place. The <ptag>garlic steak</ptag> was really <ntag>good</ntag>. The garlic <ntag>sauce</ntag> is pretty much their version of teriyaki <ntag>sauce</ntag>. It is a must try, you won't be disappointed. I went with my gf and it was our first time there. The food is absolutely <ntag>delicious</ntag>. The service is <ntag>friendly</ntag>. I wish they had one closer to my side of town. One of my new fave places to get a healthier food fix."
"I decided to try this place maninly because their delivery guy keeps coming by to <ntag>my</ntag> work. Call me intrigued, I've been three weeks on <ntag>a</ntag> diet and working hard to slim down.  I ordered the 4oz <ptag>Garlic Steak</ptag> with <ptag>brown rice</ptag> and baslamic vingrette. The <ptag>steak</ptag> was wonderful very well flavored, not a bit of fat or gristle either. I am glad this place offers <ptag>brown rice</ptag> because nutrionally it's a better choice than white and of course the <ptag>salad</ptag> greens a nice touch with the protien and <ptag>rice</ptag>. I am happy this place exists. Slight con: Trying to call them to order is difficult. Apparently their phone line gets slammed for deliveries because when I try to call all their lines are full. I guess this place is really that popular with the locals."
"Delicious healthy food!I love the convenience of eating healthy. I ordered the 6 meals for $50. The <ptag>garlic steak</ptag> is <ntag>amazing</ntag>. I'm defiantly a fan!"
"Tried the <ptag>chicken</ptag> with peanut <ntag>sauce</ntag> today. It was <ntag>yummy</ntag>. The <ptag>garlic steak</ptag> with mushrooms was still <ntag>delicious</ntag>. Same for the <ptag>kimchi</ptag>. I had the same issue though with not getting my <ptag>salad</ptag> even though I was very clear that I wanted the <ptag>asparagus</ptag> as a side and not part of my meal and again, the person taking the order asked what type of dressing I wanted on the <ptag>salad</ptag>. I partially blame myself for not checking my boxes before I left.So, the food is great. My only advice is be sure to check your order for completion before you leave. (Unlike me, lol)"
