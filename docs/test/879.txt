"We were in town after a South coast trip, and found this place on <ntag>Yelp</ntag>. We love <ntag>Middle Eastern food</ntag> in <ntag>Colorado</ntag>, and decided to try it. We are so glad we did! The waiter was so <ntag>friendly</ntag> and <ntag>helpful</ntag> (he even had pictures on his I-pad to show items we weren't sure about! ) We ordered a vegetarian appetizer (like a meal), and the <ptag>lamb</ptag> and <ptag>beef</ptag> mixed dinner with <ptag>yellow rice</ptag>. It was so fresh and delicious. If I had one criticism, I would say the <ptag>falafal</ptag> was a bit <ntag>greasy</ntag>, but still <ntag>delicious</ntag>! The homemade <ptag>pita</ptag> was a bit <ntag>thin</ntag> and <ntag>crispy</ntag>, a <ntag>wonderful</ntag> change from the <ptag>pita</ptag> we are used to! I would highly recommend this place."
