"This is the first time I enter this establishment for dinner.  I have heard it was good and that it was.  We were out for an early dinner and glad we decided on Emery's.  First of all I really enjoyed the small quaint atmosphere, quite with a home town Italian d\u00e9cor.  Italian works on the walls and many bottles of wine out for show. If they would have been playing Italian music I would have been back in Italy.  The staff was prompt and friendly.  We ordered our <ntag>drinks</ntag> and <ntag>decided</ntag> what we were going to eat.  After the order was taken we were brought a half a loaf of warm bread which had a great flavor with garlic butter on the side.  We started with an appetizer, the special they had, crab and shrimp.  We were brought cold crab claws and large shrimp, big enough you had to eat each shrimp in at least 2 bites.  For our entree's, my wife had the <ptag>Chicken Alfredo</ptag> and <ntag>I</ntag> had the Linguini and clams in a white wine sauce.  My wife enjoyed her dish enough to eat her left over later that night.  I really enjoyed mine, the Linguini was done perfectly, almost al dente, which is how all the meals were as we experienced in Italy last year.  There were plenty of minced clam to accompany clams in the shell.  I ordered <ntag>mine</ntag> with extra garlic which was done with no problem.  It was just as I hoped it would be.  Hot buttery <ntag>garlic</ntag> with an occasionally a crunch of sand, (that is how I know they use fresh clams).  I wish I had more room left to try one of their desserts.  Maybe next time.  This is a place I will visit again when I want fresh Italian food."
"It is a cute establishment but quality to price does not match up. The waitress did not like that I had brought my children and she was very hesitant to wait on us. The bread was extremely hot when brought to the table but got cold quick and became very hard to chew. The kids had an \"adult\" portion of spaghetti and meatballs which only can with two very medium to small meatballs. I had the shrimp savoy in which the flavors were not their. The mushrooms saut\u00e9ed in wine were bitter, there was too much butter, the shrimp were flavor less (but on the plus side large), and it lacked <ntag>salt</ntag>. Needless to say I will probably not return which is sad because \"old\" Henderson needs good eating establishments."
"I came with a Restaurant.com $25 gift certificate in my hands and I had read the not-so-stellar reviews here on Yelp, but when my husband and I entered this quaint establishment on a Saturday evening around 6:30 PM I was pleasantly surprised. It's a small dining area with bright colors and Italian-esque decorations covering the walls. There's a bunch of wine lining the back walls and only about 10 white-clothed tables. I have to admit I was comparing it to my favorite Italian place in town, which is in Downtown Las Vegas called Chicago Joe's. There's similarities and differences. To start off with I ordered a <ntag>glass</ntag> of raspberry iced tea, my husband, sweet tea. The tea was deliciously sweet. Next we were served some <ntag>nice</ntag>, <ntag>warm bread</ntag>, about half a loaf with some delicious garlic butter. The butter was perfectly spreadable. The bread, although a bit tough on the outside, was still good. We were offered a second helping, but we declined. I ordered the <ptag>Linquine Clams</ptag> with a red sauce. When I inquired as to whether or not the red sauce had a little spice, I was told it did not have any spice, but the waitress asked me if I would like the cook to make it spicy and I said yes! So that was very nice of my waitress to cater to my desires. My husband ordered the <ptag>Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo</ptag> and we both opted for House Salads with Ranch dressing. \n\nThe salads came out with very green leaves, shredded carrots, a few tomatoes, and a couple slices of sweet onions. In comparing this salad to the one at Chicago Joe's - this salad wins. Definitely a better variety of green lettuce leaves and a bit fresher in my opinion. \n\nNext our entrees arrived. They plate their pastas in bowl-like boat plates. They were hot and fresh, my red sauce had just the enough amount of kick to my liking. What I enjoyed a bit more about this Linquine Clam over Chicago Joe's is that there were actual clam shells with meat along with clam meat actually dispersed throughout the pasta. I think the addition of clam shells gives the dish a nice, rich oceanic flavor. It is nice to dig out the clams and get that bit of sea taste.\n\nMy husband noted that his pasta was very good, but I did not try any because I was slurping up my own. We ended up taking home leftovers and declined desert because we had a fresh pie waiting for us at home to eat.\n\nOverall the food is A+. There's no doubt about the authenticity of whoever is cooking here. The atmosphere is nice, the music was not too loud, and it is a family/casual dining experience. Service was great from our main waitress. The woman who brought us out our drinks and bread was a bit cold, but nothing so much to ruin our experience.\n\nI would certainly go back, especially if I happen to be in the Henderson area and I am craving Italian. The plus side here is that you are supporting a local mom and pop business as well. I would and will continue to gladly fork over my money to places like this over Olive Garden and Macaroni Grill."
"My husband and I were super excited to try this place since it's only a few blocks from our house, but we were thoroughly disappointed with every aspect of the experience.\n\nThe waitress who greeted us was cold and unwelcoming, and failed to mention that it was happy hour until I specifically asked her.\n\nWe ordered two glasses of wine which per the happy hour special afforded us a free cheese \"tray\". The Pinot Grigio tasted like a Chardonnay and the Riesling tasted like Apple juice. The cheese tray was 9 dice sized cubes of less than average cheese and two bundles of grapes. \n\nWe also ordered a caprese salad, which was comprised of cardboard out of season tomatoes, regular mozzarella cheese (not bufula as advertised) and topped with lettuce dressed with Italian dressing. \n\nThe complimentary French bread was dried out and uninspiring.\n\nNo part of our meal was enjoyable or inviting. We could have made infinitely better food at home and not have wasted $35 for two terrible glasses of wine, a cheap cheese plate, and a sorry salad.\n\nWill NOT be going back!"
