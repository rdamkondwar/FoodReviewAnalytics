"I drove from Buffalo NY for <ptag>Waffles</ptag>... <ntag>waffle House</ntag> <ptag>Waffles</ptag>.  I was back in early summer 2016, I chose this location based on Yelp reviews and being a newer location, I'd been in an older one in <ntag>N.Carolina</ntag>, Loved it too.  The staff was nice and friendly, the food Awesome we did the eat in <ntag>breakfast</ntag> at 8 30 pm, <ptag>eggs</ptag> <ptag>meat toast</ptag> and <ptag>WAFFLES</ptag> with pecans.  Everything was great, so great we got  an extra round and triple <ptag>waffles</ptag> to go... Return trips are planed."
"Its a beautiful day so I'm out on the motorcycle for about 4 hours and its time to get something to eat; unfortunately its Easter Sunday so not that many places are open.  Fortunately I remember that there is a <ntag>waffle House</ntag> at I-90 and Route 44.  I may lose some of my foodie cred, but even though I generally don't like chain restaurants, I do have a soft spot for the <ntag>waffle</ntag> House. This trip I ordered a <ptag>waffle</ptag> and a medium <ptag>hashbrowns</ptag> scattered and capped with <ptag>mushrooms</ptag> added.  The <ptag>waffle</ptag> is a large disc, fairly thin with a good slightly sweet flavor.  The <ptag>waffle</ptag> has a softer outside, but the inside is <ntag>fluffy</ntag> and perfect to soak up the syrup.  The <ptag>hashbrowns</ptag> are exactly what they should be, <ntag>crisped</ntag> up on the grill with good <ptag>potato</ptag> taste, but not too <ntag>greasy</ntag>.There are plenty of jokes about <ntag>waffle Houses</ntag>, but I have found that they are good road food, the food is good, service is friendly and fast, your order is cooked <ntag>fresh</ntag> and served quickly; prices are <ntag>good</ntag> and most of the time the restaurants are <ntag>clean</ntag>.   You can count on the <ntag>waffle House</ntag> to give good, decent food at a reasonable price."
"The diner from Georgia that made it real real real real real big and branched out all over the south and is <ntag>slowly</ntag> but surely making its way north and east. I'm still envious that Michigan doesn't have one of these <ntag>gastronomic</ntag> institutions. The alter ego of HiHOP. The better one if as far as I'm concerned.We ordered the t-bone <ptag>steak</ptag> combo, one for each. I ended up with the short end of the stick since for some reason, that day we walked in, was the day they only had one t-bone <ptag>steak</ptag> left. So, no big deal,,, fiance' get's the better cut. I'll just settle for the <ptag>sirloin</ptag>. Which if cooked properly, as it was, medium rare is still a pretty good cut of meat. <ptag>hashbrowns</ptag> with <ptag>mushrooms</ptag> and texas <ptag>toast</ptag> for the win. Pair that up with a hot cup of <ptag>coffee</ptag> and I am a very happy camper.The place was really nice and orderly. We seem to have walked in right before their dinner rush, so It was very empty. We did get primo seats at the bar as well. Plus, we were pretty much the only customers at the time, so we did get their full undivided attention.I had a great meal here, specially the fact that we were driving back to Detroit from Pennsylvania. Yes,, long drives can definitely work up an appetite.Thank you so much <ntag>waffle House</ntag>. You guys rock!!!"
"Love the <ntag>waffle House</ntag>. My waistline does not. But for once in a while it is just damn good stuff. Luckily it just when I am on the road."
"Gotta love <ntag>waffle house</ntag>... Butvthis one is special.... The cooks make your food the way you like it.... And everyone is very friendly!"
"The <ntag>waffle House</ntag> is always good!!  But then I love <ptag>waffles</ptag>!  I reviewed this one only because it's where I drive to pick up my sister when she's coming to visit from Erie PA.  It's like halfway between Medina, OH, where I live, and Erie.  My brother-in-law brings her there for the drop-off!!  : ))   Everyone probably knows about <ntag>waffle House</ntag>.  They are all the same.  Friendly staff that say hello to you when you come in the door and the famous large plate-sized <ptag>waffle</ptag>.  Of course there's other good breakfast items too.  Try the scattered potatos!  Mmmm.  Not much real healthy here : ))  Casual and cheap."
