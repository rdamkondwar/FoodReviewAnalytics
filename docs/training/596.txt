"I should declare an interest: every day for a great many years my grandad sat in <ntag>Foresters</ntag> (he called it <ntag>Kelly's</ntag>, after the landlord) reading his paper nursing his half n' half, so I have a sentimental attachment to the place.  I should also say however that it wasn't much of a pub before and so it was ripe for refurbishment.  The insides have been totally gutted to create a main bar with a <ntag>smaller</ntag> restaurant section.  There is also a snug\\small side room and a <ntag>quirky</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> garden consisting of beach huts.  The bar has a <ntag>decent</ntag> selection of real ales as well as the more traditional Tennents etc.  Reasonable <ptag>wine</ptag> selection.  The stand out though is the food which is high end /gastro pub style.  Pulled </ptag>pork burgers</ptag>, </ptag>cheese steak</ptag>, </ptag>fish</ptag> and </ptag>chips</ptag>, with a <ntag>good</ntag> selection of seasonal specials. The staff are <ntag>great</ntag> and the place is <ntag>welcoming</ntag> (kids up to 8pm and dog friendly). Would my grandad have liked it?  I think he probably would."
"The very <ntag>best</ntag> service, a mix of traditional and modern, and as far as we can tell from one visit a very <ntag>good</ntag> kitchen. A <ntag>perfect</ntag> place for a <ptag>beer</ptag> and food after work."
