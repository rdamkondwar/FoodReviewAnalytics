"We stumbled upon Taste of Yunnan while looking for a place to eat in Toronto. The food tasted authentic, and the server was very helpful and kind. We ordered the <ptag>steamed chicken soup</ptag>, <ptag>steamed beef</ptag>, and <ptag>spicy beef noodles</ptag>. Each dish (the first two were more like small appetizers) was delicious, and the meat from the steamed appetizers literally melted in our mouths. They also have devices on each table for you to signal to the waiter if you need service/water/bill/etc. it was our first time in Toronto, and we were pleased with our <ntag>meal</ntag>."
