Long time waiting,  <ptag>fried rice</ptag> was <ntag>good</ntag>, <ptag>curry hot pot</ptag> was <ntag>amazing</ntag> and the <ptag>squab</ptag> was a huge <ntag>disappointment</ntag>.  Especially since we waited so very long for it. Skip this place, maybe the food in the cafe was <ntag>better</ntag>."
