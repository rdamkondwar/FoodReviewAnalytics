"From the moment there was zero service when my <ntag>companion</ntag> and <ntag>I</ntag> tepped in the door, I should have taken the foreshadowed hint and bailed on this place as fast as I could, but I soldiered on, visualizing the four stars that other Yelpers had averaged out on this place. It could be just a fluke, right? I could not have been more incorrect. It took three minutes to even be noticed by one of the employees there, and she was a waitress, not a hostess. She had to nudge a nearby host to finally come over and place us at our very suddenly, hastily prepared table, menus tossed in a pile at the center. After taking a moment to <ntag>figure</ntag> out what we wanted to <ntag>eat</ntag>, we waited patiently for a few minutes, politely and quietly with our menus closed, still waiting for a waiter or waitress to greet and serve us water. It was not until a short while later when our order was being taken when water would finally be served to us, after my companion had to ask. At this point we were already skeptical of this establishment, but when the food was served to us, (In quick fashion, at least) more disappointment struck. We had ordered a Pad Thai and Spicy Peanut Butter Chicken. The <ptag>Pad Thai's noodles</ptag> were undercooked, but otherwise had a <ntag>delicious</ntag> taste. The <ptag>Chicken</ptag> wasn't very complex. Tasted like a mix of way too much Hoisin, some sugar and <ptag>Peanut</ptag> Butter. It was very much swimming in <ntag>sauce</ntag> and it didn't feel like it had too much complexity to the dish. It was at least moderately <ntag>spicy</ntag>. Further, both dishes were warm at best - definitely not <ntag>fresh</ntag> from the kitchen, despite the speed with which the dishes were served. Portion sizes were only decent for the cost and quality. No one came to check on us during the course of our meal, and my empty water glass stood quite empty in a very conspicuous location on the table for over five minutes while waiters walked by repeatedly. Atrocious service. The Bubble Tea I ordered was <ntag>probably</ntag> the best part of my meal, despite the typical cost of the drink. After a very dis-satisfactory experience, we were <ntag>planning</ntag> on leaving a very small tip. However you can not, since the tip is added for you automatically! A 15% Service Charge! - In what establishment for, a party of two, do you automatically have to tip 15%? I didn't notice any such an implication on the menu itself, however I couldn't go back to check either. I believe that is <ntag>absolutely</ntag> ridiculous. It is very hard to recommend this place over some of the very excellent dining establishments that encircle Vaughan Mills, such as Lucky Bamboo and Truly Thai. Will definitely not be dining here again, and I recommend everyone to avoid if you value your time and money.Of note, they also serve Shark Fin <ptag>soup</ptag>. To some this is unacceptable especially given the recent ban in <ntag>the</ntag> City of Toronto. Food for thought."
"Have been going here for over a year. Never been disappointed, last night 4 of us went and eat way too much with a bottle of <ptag>wine</ptag> for $120.00. The service is great and the food seems like it's on your table in <ntag>no</ntag> time. Every time I go or take out , I try something new. Last night it was <ntag>the</ntag> Spicy Orange <ptag>Beef</ptag>, excellent. If you are looking for a meal in a bowl, try the <ntag>Spicy</ntag> <ptag>Beef Noodle Soup</ptag>. Surprising considering that everything else is very <ntag>good</ntag>, <ptag>fried rice</ptag> is not up to par with the rest of the fair. It's to greasy for my liking, so I now stick to the <ptag>plain rice</ptag>."
