"You get what you pay for.... Is usually what comes to <ntag>mind</ntag> with the <ptag>pizza</ptag>, However this statement contradicts itself after tasting the <ptag>pizza</ptag> and having to pay for refills on soda. The prices were a bit high for <ptag>pizza</ptag> and small size <ptag>wings</ptag>. Not that it isn't bad but just not <ntag>great</ntag>. If your stomach is empty and need to <ntag>fill</ntag> space this will satisfy just don't expect a cacophony of flavors. So here comes the frustrating part, my family decide to <ntag>have</ntag> a little celebration at <ntag>the</ntag> place and had a <ptag>cake</ptag> they asked to store until the time was right to sing birthday wishes. Upon receiving the <ptag>cake</ptag> there was a bug in the <ptag>cake</ptag> that who knows where it came from. None the less the party went on. On a side note..they should smile more when they are behind the counter. They stand their like bouncers hovering over the customers."
"I <ntag>LOVE</ntag> the <ptag>pizza</ptag> and <ptag>wings</ptag> here! Ask for the <ptag>wings</ptag> hot and crispy and <ntag>you</ntag> won't be disappointed.  Try the specials and take some home too. You'll be back for more...and so will <ntag>we</ntag>."
"Love this place. <ptag>Pizza</ptag> is delicious, <ptag>wings</ptag> are good as well. <ptag>Pizza</ptag> is some of the best in the valley. Must try"
