"It is such a cute <ptag>cupcake</ptag> shop, It  was one of my <ntag>best</ntag> trips down to the beaches when I got a groupon for 30 dollars worth of <ptag>cupcakes</ptag> for there. Its nice because you can buy all sorts of things for your kitchen, along with <ptag>bread</ptag>, speads, <ptag>cupcake</ptag> lipglosses, you name it and walk out with a <ntag>really good</ntag> <ptag>cupcake</ptag>. I did find them a little dry but that could have been the time of day I went in, either way it has never been an issue enough for me not to go back there. The icing is <ntag>really good</ntag> aswell. The staff are nice too. Worth the trip to the beach everytime."
