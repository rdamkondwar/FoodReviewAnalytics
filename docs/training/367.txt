"Tis a shame that such a <ntag>cool place</ntag> could have mediocre food. Let's start with the pros. There's an enormously cool playground for little ones. Parents can chit chat while the little ones get crazy. The <ntag>atmosphere</ntag> is laid back and inviting. Cool breezes and shade from tall greenery make this a wonderful place for a meal. \n\nThe <ntag>food</ntag> itself leaves much to be desired. There's a <ntag>guy</ntag> grilling <ptag>steaks</ptag> outside and for a mere 7 euros, it's not a bad choice. In fact, that's the <ntag>wisest</ntag> choice. The <ntag>rest</ntag> of the menu is very bland. I got the <ptag>Obazda</ptag>: a <ptag>ball of cheese</ptag> with <ptag>onions</ptag>, slices of bread, pat of butter for euros. Mehhh.... wouldn't do that again. \n\nKids had the <ptag>bratwurst</ptag>...it was ok. \n\nNow who was the yelper who said the <ptag>cheesecake</ptag> was good? Good is a word I would never use for their cheesecake. The crust was breadlike. The cheesecake filling was no where near <ntag>creamy</ntag> or <ntag>sweet</ntag>. Imagine crushed <ptag>styrofoam</ptag> in a shade of deceiving yellow. Yap..that's what I got. The <ptag>apple pie</ptag> isn't much better. The apple filling resembled an apple pie but the flavor was bland and the crust resembled stale bread. I was soooo disappointed! Crust by nature has to be flaky, not powdery...crispy, not mushy...someone send the cook back to <ntag>pastry school</ntag>... STAT!\n\nWould I come again? Yes...I just won't expect palatable food...save for the steak. It's not great steak...but it's not bad either."
