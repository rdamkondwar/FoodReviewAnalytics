"<ntag>Great</ntag> <ptag>pizza</ptag>. <ntag>Fresh</ntag>, <ntag>fast</ntag> and <ntag>friendly</ntag> service. Although small, the location looks great and is always immaculate. My only knock would be the price. It's a little much for the size of the <ptag>pizza</ptag> but they use <ntag>fresh</ntag>, <ntag>high</ntag> quality ingredients. You get what you pay for though. I'd rather pay more for quality than quantity. The family that owns this establishment are always kind while still hustling and bustling around the joint."
