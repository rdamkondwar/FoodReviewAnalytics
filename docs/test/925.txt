"I like Wendy's. Of all the fast food joints Wendy's is one of my choices just because, in my opinion, their <ptag>burgers</ptag> taste much better. I've seen my fair share of good Wendys', bad Wendys' and Wendys' where crass cashiers with too much make up and hoola hoop for earrings are allowed to engage in crass, insulting and demeaning arguments with their customer and are then protected by their managers. This Wendy's is dead smack in the middle with maybe a few fractions of a degree tilting towards good. Not because they are actually good but because in the fast food industry if you don't majorly suck, you're leaning towards good. I actually went through the drive through and we were helped with a very nice \"Thank you for choosing Wendy's, 'can' I take your order\" which already beats 99% of other similar establishments and their usual, \"Take y'order\" greeting. We pulled around, paid and politely were told to pull ahead as one of our items was being \"put together\". Fair enough.\n\nWe waited no more than a couple of minutes and our food came right out to our window. Overall a good, fast and accurate experience.\n\nThen I realized why Wendy's is known as a BURGER JOINT.\n\nI ordered a <ptag>Crispy Chicken Caesar Wrap</ptag>. The wrapper, for whatever reason was soaked in, what I hoped, was water but fortunately the wrap itself was dry. Not a bad taste except for the actual Caesar dressing which was too strong and salty for my taste. And I love <ntag>salty</ntag> food!\n\nI also ordered the <ptag>Berry Almond Chicken Salad</ptag> which was a nice portion (I couldn't finish it). It was as decent as any pre-packaged salad with Raspberry syrup disguised as salad dressing can be. The chicken was a little too spiced for me... not spicy, but whatever spices they used for the chicken it just had too much. The entire thing was very bland but exceptionally the blueberries. The salad also had some flat, white, tasteless strips of what I thought was Provolone cheese but turned out to be Asiago. It really didn't add much to the salad. I couldn't detect the almond flavor even though I felt the crunch of the almonds as I chewed. The strawberries on the other hand were nice, big, plump and nicely sweet. At $4.50 thought? I think I overpaid a buck fiddy...\n\nFrom now on, I'm sticking to burger though."
"THE most GHETTO ran Wendy's I have ever been to. I have never been more grossed out by eating in my life than I did when I ate here. The staff is GHETTO and RUDE and the food was HORRIBLE. It was cold and old food. I feel like I may get food poisoning after the few bites I ate of my <ptag>chicken sandwich</ptag>. I was going to complain, but then I looked at the staff working and thought, what's the point?! I knew how that would have ended. Ghetto staff means lack of caring! Stay away from this Wendy's, save yourself the stomach ache and head ache!"
