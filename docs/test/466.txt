"I've walked by this pub a few times and finally stopped in for lunch.\nI was expecting a dark, maybe a little run down kind of place.  But, it was very bright, and well kept.  The U shaped bar was lined with beer from all over the world.  Nice selection you don't see everywhere. I ordered the <ptag>buffalo chicken wrap</ptag>, with fries.  The wrap was very good.  The <ptag>chicken</ptag> was tossed in a buffalo sauce that had just enough kick to let you know what you were eating.  The fries were...well fries and tasted good.\nI'll definitely be putting the Wallace into the Friday lunch/beer rotation!"
"Came here for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night. Other than our group, it wasn't that busy. \n\nThe Wallace has a large selection of beer. Some from local craft brewers and others from all around the world. We were told to order Delirium and were vastly disappointed at the size of the beer for the cost (around $7 for less than half a pint). Other beers were a lot smaller in portion size than we thought as well. On their menu, they offer a sparkling white wine and it's stated that it's $9 for 200mL. Imagine my surprise when I was handed the smallest champagne flute imaginable. There was MAYBE 100mL in the glass. Small alcohol portions aside, we did order a few food items off the menu. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 ordered their <ptag>Wallace burger</ptag> with fries, I ordered their turkey burger with fries, and my friend ordered their mussels. My fianc\u00e9 enjoyed his burger and it was a fair size served with cheese and bacon. However, they are pretty cheap with the fries. He got half a bowl of it. My turkey burger was very dry and I personally wasn't a fan of it. I got slightly more fries than my fianc\u00e9 did. Both burgers were served on a potato bun and it was very hard to eat them because they had every intention of falling apart in our hands. My friend really seemed to enjoy her mussels. There was a good portion and it was served with toast. \n\nService was sub par. No quality checks were made and one of our friends didn't have cutlery. He had to go into the server station to get it himself. I asked for water a few times at the end of the night and it took three tries before I got a glass. Originally a two star rating, but I respect restaurants that pride themselves in using local, high quality ingredients, as stated on their menu."
"I have been coming to this pub for about 5 years. It was called The Twisted Kilt before changing its name to The Wallace Gastropub. The owner is the same.  I was told by the owner the reason for the change of name is because they did not want to be confused with the Tilted Kilt that just recently came to Toronto, and with a recent fire next door about a year ago that caused smoke damage. The owner thought it only fitting to do renovations along with the name change.  I have to honestly say this pub has never let me down.  The food has always been amazing and I really enjoy the beer selection!"
"I came here with my older brother and younger sister for a reunion of sorts. I had never visited this pub before, but it was a convenient location for us. Upon walking in, I fell in love. I felt like I had been transported to the Emerald Isle. Whilst feeling dumbfounded, I realized I did not know the mores of the establishment and sort of awkwardly waited until a lovely and friendly bar-man, Peter, hooked me up and pointed me to the back patio which was really quaint and private.\n\nThe beer selection was awesome and the food was superb. I had a chicken madras dish; it was <ntag>perfect</ntag>. \n\nI really appreciated the super-friendly staff and their willingness to entertain our off-colour brand of humour. Our server was really fun to engage with and she gave us perfect suggestions through out the night.\n\nI will definitely be back!!!"
"Nice pub, really. Friend had the Salmon dinner and really enjoyed it; I had a House Salad and the Vegetarian Flatbread. Both <ntag>good</ntag>! \n\nBut let's talk about the real reason I came: THE BEER. So nice to have a place in North York with decent craft beer options on tap! Black Oak Pale Ale, Side Launch Pale Ale, Beau's Lug Tread, Muskoka's Mad Tom, etc. Mondays are MICROBREW MONDAYS where all pints of Ontario craft are just $5!\n\nAlso on tap: <ntag>Delerium Tremens</ntag>! <ntag>Houblon Chouffe</ntag>! Have I mentioned this place has good beer?! Washrooms downstairs were nice and clean -- believe they have a main floor washroom as well for anyone that can't do stairs. Overall: most enjoyable. Look forward to returning."
"(Copied from The Tilted Kilt review as it was called Wallace Gastropub already when I went) I came here for one of Andre D's urbanist meetups. The name for this place has been changed from Twisted Kilt to Wallace Gastropub.\n\nThe inside environment was quite decent, and the servers were overall good...that is if you can wave one down. Otherwise, you're in for a bit of a wait. I had a few instances where I had to wait a good ten minutes to wave down my waitress (if it was an Asian restaurant I'd wave down anyone, but since it's not...).\n\nI ordered a <ptag>bison burger</ptag> with a Kronenbourg. The beer was quite good (in fact I really love the variety of alcohol in this place), but the burger was somewhat disappointing...the meat was extremely dry and mushy for my liking (I like the patty medium to medium well usually). I'll definitely try something else next time I come back here."
