"I've never been to the other locations before so <ntag>I</ntag> can't compare this one to the others, but I loved it and would definitely come back in the future (and would try other locations).First off, the interior is really <ntag>nice</ntag>. <ntag>We</ntag> were a group of 6 that came for a birthday, and we were seated <ntag>promptly</ntag>.  Actually, because we came on the actual day of someone's birthday, they got <ntag>their</ntag> meal free which is pretty <ntag>nice</ntag>.  The service was <ntag>great</ntag>, all of the servers were <ntag>fast</ntag>, friendly and accommodating.Everything that I tried from the buffet was <ntag>great</ntag>.  But the <ptag>meat</ptag>, all of it, was just <ntag>yummy</ntag>.  I LOVED at all of the <ptag>meat</ptag> was rare....as someone who always eats <ptag>meat</ptag> rare (and will request blue on occasion) this was great for <ntag>me</ntag> and everyone else in my group.  I have a personal pet peeve of places that overcook <ptag>steak</ptag>.  Now if you like your <ptag>meat</ptag> more well done (slightly judgmental of me here, but if you are going out for <ptag>steak</ptag> and order anything above a medium rare I think it's a waste of a good cut of <ptag>meat</ptag>/money/time LOL) you should probably request this ahead of time, so that you aren't <ntag>disappointed</ntag>. The cinnamon roasted <ptag>pineapple</ptag> is to die for and the <ptag>cornbread</ptag> is <ntag>amazing</ntag>.Overall great experience and would come back."
"Absolutely <ntag>great</ntag> is my opinion from one visit but it it's new and so will need to go more often . Rodozio is particularly prone to quality variation as an unreliable issue.So far so very good All cuts medium rare , really <ntag>tender</ntag> , <ntag>tasty</ntag> And plenty of choice and <ntag>quick</ntag> service <ptag>Salads</ptag> very good and good quality <ptag>Cheese bread</ptag> really big and fresh ; prefer <ntag>smaller</ntag> but what kind of complaint is that ??Go and enjoy Didn't even get to see music or dancers But who cares That's just a plus I'm <ntag>sure</ntag>"
"We dined here in a group of 6 on a Tuesday night. The atmosphere is super modern and <ntag>comfortable</ntag>! We were waited on quickly and got right down to <ntag>eating</ntag>. :)I loved the  cheese-stuffed prime <ptag>rib</ptag>, top <ptag>sirloin</ptag>, <ptag>bacon</ptag> wrapped filet <ptag>mignon</ptag>, <ptag>garlic steak</ptag>... Sooo tasty and <ntag>juicy</ntag>!! And the <ptag>salad</ptag> bar was even tastier than other Copacabana restaurants I've been to (eg. the <ptag>mashed potatoes</ptag> are the fluffiest I've ever had). Make sure to order some freshly baked <ptag>corn</ptag> <ptag>bread</ptag> for your table!The service was very <ntag>attentive</ntag>. Numerous times servers asked us if everything was good and if we had any requests. At one point, a member of our party turned down some top <ptag>sirloin</ptag> because she prefers it well done, and several minutes later the server came back with a well done piece cooked just for her! (How nice!) Overall it was a <ntag>great</ntag> and <ntag>delicious</ntag> experience and I can't wait to go <ntag>again</ntag>! P.S. I'll note that the restaurant may be a little difficult to find, as it's in <ntag>an</ntag> industrial area and the sign is hard to see at night. The front patio of the restaurant is still under <ntag>construction</ntag>. If <ntag>you</ntag> get lost, look for the number 205."
