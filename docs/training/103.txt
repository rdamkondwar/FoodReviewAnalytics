"Amazingly <ntag>fresh</ntag> <ptag>sashimi</ptag>/<ptag>sushi</ptag>!! Better than <ptag>Sushi</ptag> RockThe atmosphere is a little quiet and hidden in <ntag>the</ntag> back of a shopping <ntag>plaza</ntag>.  It's a <ntag>small</ntag> little restaurant with a few tables and a quaint little <ptag>sushi</ptag> bar.  It seems like a small mom and pop restaurant.  I like a louder and busier atmosphere. It's a Korean family that runs the Japanese restaurant.  The <ptag>sushi</ptag> is soo <ntag>fresh</ntag>.  It doesn't have a fishy taste whatsoever- extremely fresh.  Get <ptag>sashimi</ptag>- you won't need any soy <ntag>sauce</ntag> or <ptag>rice</ptag> to eat with it.  It's delicious by itself.  The teriyaki <ptag>salmon</ptag> is one of my sister's favorites- with a nice <ntag>crispy</ntag> skin with a sweet and slightly <ntag>tangy sauce</ntag>, (personally, it's not the <ntag>best</ntag> I've had)  The side <ptag>salad</ptag> is like any other <ptag>salad</ptag> you can get an a Japanese restaurant with the <ptag>ginger</ptag> dressing.   Skip the Udon <ptag>noodle</ptag> <ptag>soups</ptag>, they are bland on <ntag>flavor</ntag> and I've had much better at <ntag>Korean</ntag> restaurants.  They also have a <ntag>small</ntag> selection of Japanese sodas and <ptag>beer</ptag> too.It's a <ntag>little</ntag> on the pricey side, but well worth it for the freshness of the <ptag>fish</ptag>!"
"Went on <ntag>a</ntag> rainy day for the <ptag>sushi</ptag> happy hour with my 10 year-old son. The kid likes <ptag>sushi</ptag> but only <ptag>vegetable maki rolls</ptag>. The first order had some <ntag>slimy</ntag> brown thing inside the waitress told us it was Japanese <ptag>carrots</ptag>. <ntag>It</ntag> was the size of a canned bamboo shoot and limp. The second order for sonny after he poked all the brown limp thing out of the first was another <ptag>vegetable roll</ptag> but he did not want the <ptag>asparagus</ptag> and we asked if <ntag>they</ntag> would substitute american slivered <ptag>carrots</ptag> (you know like regular veggie <ptag>sushi</ptag>) ooohhhh no not during happy hour. Hello, <ptag>asparagus</ptag> is at least $2.99 a pound and <ptag>carrots</ptag> can be found for lots less. This made me think that they are cheap <ntag>people</ntag>. I ordered the miso with shumai <ptag>dumplings</ptag>. The addition of the 3 shumai pumped the price of the tiny bowl miso from $2.00 to $4.50. I asked if the <ptag>shumai</ptag> were <ntag>pre-made</ntag> and once <ntag>frozen</ntag> and the server said yes and I flat out told her that the <ptag>soup</ptag> was a <ntag>rip-off</ntag>.
