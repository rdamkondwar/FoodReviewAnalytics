"The food is <ntag>pretty good</ntag>, <ntag>fresh</ntag> ingredients. I ordered <ptag>lemon chicken</ptag> and <ptag>chicken with vegetables</ptag>, along with <ptag>wonton soup</ptag>. <ptag>Lemon chicken</ptag> had way too much vinegar, my eyes were watering even from the smell and it burned my lips. I scraped off as much of the <ntag>lemon sauce</ntag> as I could since the <ptag>chicken</ptag> itself was <ntag>really good</ntag>. I was <ntag>pleasantly</ntag> surprised they used <ptag>chicken breast</ptag>. Vegetables in the other dish were <ntag>fresh</ntag> and <ntag>crunchy</ntag>. <ptag>Wonton soup</ptag> was <ntag>very good</ntag>, it earned the 4th star.The staff are really friendly and efficient. Restaurant itself is brand new and therefore very clean. Decor could be better, it's too generic looking."
