From the start it was very off putting and they denied compensation of any kind. We checked in and request the wifi ($5 a night) this would be fine, but the Wifi doesn't work! It constantly disconnects and has a very poor connection. This was the least of our worries, as we entered our room we noticed a musty stench... The room smelt <ntag>awful</ntag>! The vents were covered in mold and we all woke up with sore throats because of the smell. The furniture in the room was ripped up and the carpets had stains all over the place. This room was disgusting! The A/Cs in the room had mold and dust all over them, the filters were also never changed and to top it off the outlets were completely exposed. This hotel was absolutely <ntag>disgusting</ntag> and an <</ntag>ntag>awful</ntag> place to stay for the price. It is not only a health and safety issue, but the price that they charge is <ntag>ridiculous</ntag>. We paid a 4 star rate for a hotel that was half star quality. Seriously this place is <ntag>awful</ntag> and if you even consider staying here after reading this you shouldn't be traveling. Hopefully they see this post and realize how <ntag>poor</ntag> their customer <ntag>service</ntag> is and smarten up."
