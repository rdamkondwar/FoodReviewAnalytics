"Ordered tapas with <ptag>fried avocado</ptag>, <ptag>zucchini</ptag>, and <ptag>potato</ptag> for an appetizer. For my main course I ordered <ptag>udon</ptag> with <ptag>tempura</ptag>. The <ntag>fried foods</ntag> (<ptag>tapas</ptag> and <ptag>tempura</ptag>) were <ntag>perfect</ntag> and they give <ntag>salt</ntag> powder like in Japan . It was delicious and the right amount of crispy. Wasn't too greasy for being fried. The <ptag>udon</ptag> was <ntag>delicious</ntag> and the <ptag>noodles</ptag> had a nice chewy texture. The broth was <ntag>quite delicious</ntag> and not too <ntag>salty</ntag> but had a lot of flavor. The waitresses got a few of our orders wrong, wasn't <ntag>too happy</ntag> about that. Overall, <ntag>good</ntag> food."
"Must eat in Vegas! Luv the <ptag>hand roll</ptag> and <ptag>miso soup</ptag>. In fact we love everything we have enjoyed!"
