The comedians were all funny with one exception, the <ntag>pacing</ntag> was great, and the atmosphere has an authenticity to it: the place is decorated and maintained just well enough to promote health-code-compliance-style ease but avoid pretension.  Feels like the real thing.  \n\nToronto is lucky to have so much available talent that a place like this can exist and charge such low admission prices--and still not gouge patrons on the beer and food.   I foresee a Comedy Bar excursion at least on a monthly basis."
"This is no Yuk Yuks. No Second City either. You may have guessed it... not all that funny, and kind of grungy for my taste. A note for all the deal buyers out there: this place is often on deal for $20. Not worth it. Not even worth $10. \n\nI came here with some colleagues from work. The ticket for the comedy show was $8. The guys bought beer. I got myself a Vodka Cran. Regular drinks, nothing fancy here. The place itself is super dive. And I was surprised at the crowd it brought in on a Friday night. I wouldn't be a second timer. \n\nWe walked into a dark room with a dinky stage set up for the comedy acts. The chairs weren't comfortable either. The acts were apparently selection from the Toronto Comedy Fest. Well, 1 out of the 5 we saw brought out 2 laughs out of me. Some of the guys I was with guffawed at the other ones - but guys will laugh at anything. One act, in particular, was a whole new level of crass. A girl ran around the audience seating throwing panties at people. My colleague ended up with 2 pink panties... out of which one was kid's underwear. \n\nI wish we'd gone to Yuk Yuks instead. Never coming back."
"I come for the <ptag>BeerProv</ptag>.  Nothing fancy about this place, chairs aren't even that comfortable, space is kind of cramped but I like it.   Excellent crowd, great staff and decent enough beer to keep you happy.  If you like Improv  and some really funny Canadian content please support this space."
"I suppose there is a common trend building with my reviews here on Yelp. But when a girl likes comedy...she really likes comedy! \nI'm super happy to give Comedy Bar hi-fives all around. The <ntag>food</ntag> is cheap and cheerful (who doesn't like coleslaw now that our parents aren't forcing us to eat it?), and the kitchen is open late. There are comedy shows (often two) every single night, and space available for rent for rehearsals or pow wows during the day. I like the peeps that hang around (some girl I didn't even know bought me a pint last night just because), and love that the space was built by most of the people who perform there now. I like a community! Call me simple...but I totally dig it.\nCheck out Sunday Night Luve (on Sundays...obviously), Catch23 (Mondays), Project! Project! (Wednesdays), Impromptu Splendor (Thursdays), and other special events like the Oscar Party this Sunday (22nd), and The Subway Series on April 26th (a co pro with GhostJail Theatre and Sunday Night Live)!!!"
"When I have a guest come to stay with me and they ask what can I walk to that is <ntag>fun</ntag> - The Comedy Bar is the only place that comes to mind.  The people are <ntag>great</ntag>!  The comedy can be hilarious, and sometimes terrible - but they always try.  And new forms of comedy aren't afraid of this platform either.  Like the improvised re-imagining of John Hughes' Some Kind of Wonderful! The prices are fair, the beer is cold, and even if you're not going to a show the lounge area is a place to come and relax.  Definitely my favourite place in Dovercourt!"
