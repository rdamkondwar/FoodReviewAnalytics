It's lovely because they give these small partions and you can really taste everything. The prices are more than <ntag>fair</ntag> for the quality. I really loved the <ptag>soup<\tag and <ptag>arancini</ptag> from the Thistletown High School Chef, such enthusiastic and smiling students and teacher, Santo Pecado offering was also delicious as well as the <ptag>chocolate tofu pudding</ptag> from Grow Op. Oh, and of course I didn't miss Mapleton's delicious organic <ptag>ice cream</ptag>. That said, next year I'm tasting truly everything!I'm not much of a drinker, but there were also <ntag>great</ntag> organic <ptag>wines</ptag> and craft <ptag>beers</ptag>. Everybody was very <ntag>nice</ntag> and smiling!As said, there were so many stalls to check out, it's impossible to name them all, however I can say that most of them were also offering some <ntag>great</ntag> deals."
