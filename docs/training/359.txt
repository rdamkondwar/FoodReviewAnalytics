"Any dining establishment that caters to my kids is a go-to for me! I love this place! \n\nAtmosphere: family oriented. The place is family-owned and they extend that family feel to their customers. My husband orders a <ptag>greek salad</ptag> but he asks them to leave off the <ptag>tomatoes</ptag> and <ptag>cucumbers</ptag>. The owner acts like this is fine with her while I stand there and laugh! They are awesome!\n\nThey have the best <ptag>rice</ptag> that I've ever had. My kids beg to go there and eat some <ptag>rice</ptag>.\n\nThe <ptag>pita</ptag> and <ptag>hummus</ptag> is just insane delicious. Whenever we are waiting for our food, they pop over with some warm, fresh <ptag>pita</ptag> slices for our children. \n\nThe <ptag>chicken souvlaki</ptag> plate is my staple there. The <ptag>chicken</ptag> is marinated to perfection and the <ptag>rice</ptag> and <ptag>salad</ptag> accompaniment are the perfect meal!\n\nWe've tried the <ptag>falafel</ptag> and the texture is perfect. The flavors blend well with the <ptag>sauce</ptag>, <ptag>onions</ptag> and <ptag>falafel</ptag> and it tastes heavenly.\n\nThe <ptag>baklava</ptag> is the BEST I've ever had! \n\nWish they had more seating (it's almost always full when we go in to eat). We often take the food to go for this reason.\n\nDon't miss the <ptag>rice pudding</ptag>!!!"
"PERFECT Greek food.  I got a <ptag>chicken santorini sandwich</ptag> the other day, but I substituted <ptag>pita</ptag> for the roll it normally comes on.  It was THE BEST THING I EVER ATE, hands-down.  The Great Greek continues to impress me!"
"I crave <ntag>greek food</ntag> every now and then. I'm so glad this place is right in front of my house. My favorite is the really warm <ptag>pita bread</ptag> with <ptag>hummus</ptag>!! I can eat <ptag>pita bread</ptag> everyday. :)"
"I decided to try Greek food for the second time in my life. As a Jamaican Chinese, I fancy myself knowing a thing or two about delicious food. I was absolutely thrilled with the high quality of the food itself and the service. I had the <ptag>Greek Salad</ptag> with the <ptag>grilled chicken</ptag> and it was flavorful, fresh and delicious. The <ptag>pita</ptag> was also warm, fresh and delicious. The handsome young fellow serving and being ever so busy was very welcoming and warm. His attitude ensures that I will be coming back as well. Thank you for the great experience."
"YUM. Go try this food!!! This is some of the best Greek food I've had, and I've tried a lot! The <ptag>avgolemono soup</ptag> was awesome and definitely ranks high up there on some of the best I've tried. The <ptag>tzatziki</ptag> was just perfect, and not overly <ntag>garlicky</ntag>. The marinated <ptag>chicken skewers</ptag> were d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s.....tender, juicy, savory, and just delectable. The <ptag>rice</ptag> that came with the <ptag>chicken</ptag> was also amazing...<ntag>buttery</ntag>, flavorful, and so so good.\n\nIt looks like a family run place, and they're very service oriented. Very nice ambiance too--casual and modern, but still inviting enough to stay and eat. Highly recommended!!!"
