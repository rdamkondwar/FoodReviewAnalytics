"very crowded. definitely should have made reservations, we waited for about an hour. <ptag>dumplings</ptag> were good as starters, six small pieces. then i had the <ptag>kung pao chicken</ptag> but was <ntag>dissappointed</ntag> that there were no vegetables in <ntag>it</ntag>, none. it  tasted <ntag>good</ntag> but not what i was expecting. my friend ordered <ptag>pepper steak</ptag> which looked more delicious :)"
"Me and wife really enjoy <ntag>eating</ntag> at this <ntag>place</ntag>. It's modern, tasty, and comfy. The only real complaint i have about this place is that the hostess or host whichever is working at the time seems like there doing you a favor by letting you eat at this establishment. The <ptag>hot and sour soup</ptag> is the <ntag>best</ntag> i have had in <ntag>Pittsburgh</ntag>, <ntag>really</ntag> <ntag>good</ntag> and <ntag>filling</ntag>!"
