"We went to Vegas for vacation and wanted to book a trip to the grand canyon. My daughter wanted to go to the skywalk she read about. I looked into tours from Vegas and read some reviews about how people were rushed from spot to spot. This did not seam like we would enjoy ourselves. I decided to create our own tour so I rented a SUV from budget rentals at our hotel. We made reservation on line with the Indians at destinationgrandcanyon.com  I booked the tour and lunch. I have to say this was the best trip we ever had. We took our time to see all we wanted to see, stayed as long as we wanted and eat as much as we could. You need to know up front that the West rim is not easy to get to. The SUV was needed to make the 14 miles of off road driving more acceptable to my passengers. The dust is thick and it gets everywhere. I felt sorry for the people I saw driving a mustang convertible. You also need to know its about $75.00 per person to get in, take the  walk and have lunch. This trip was worth ever penny.  You pay $20.00 to park then the Indians take you to different points on a bus. You can stay at each point as long as you like because the buses run every ten minutes. The lunch was excellent its all you can eat  ribs, BBQ, chicken or taco's. If you are thinking of going now would be a good time . It is primitive, no railings and no big buildings. They have plans  of building restaurants a casino. It wont be the same then. I say get over the prices you have to pay its all worth it. There were 5 of us and including gas we payed less than if we booked it at the hotel.(160pp)\nGO SEE THE WEST RIM"
"Great views of the canyon. Bought the legacy gold package with lunch. Stopped at eagle point and guano point. Had a great <ntag>lunch</ntag> - black bean burger, chips, soda and an orange. Shuttles move quickly and bathrooms were clean. Highly recommend."
"We went to The Skywalk while on vacation with our three almost grown kids. I had looked on line and read up on the Skywalk. I feel that their website made it pretty clear. It is quite a drive from Las Vegas but we made a day of it. My best advice: if you think you might get separated because there are three locations. bring walkie talkies. Cell service is nonexistent. When you get there you park in the parking lot and go in the white bubble building. you purchase which ever package you want. We got the Legacy Gold package. They have shuttles to the three destinations. \nThe first destination was like a western style town. Gun fights magician,  mechanical bull, horses, and shops.my family tried their hand at roping cattle. (Fake cattle of course). they have a bar b q place to eat their but we choose not to eat. \nsecond stop was the skywalk. you are not allowed to take anything on the skywalk. therefore they provide lockers for no extra charge. you wear booties on your shoes assuming to protect the glass. they have three photographers on the skywalk to take your picture. My daughter who is vegetarian and I ate at this location. The food was ok. She got a black bean burger and i had a turkey sandwich it came with a small bag of chips and an orange. they had an asian choice at this location too  they did not have a salad option.\n the third stop was just as beautiful as the last maybe more. the rest of my family ate here and said the food was ok, but they got a side salad, meat potatoes, green beans, a roll and cookie. we did not get a cookie. \nIf you are on a budget. I suggest not doing the skywalk. it was cool and all but not worth the 25.00 to me. However, i do not like heights. we were there about three hours the people who worked there we friendly. I am glad we went."
"ok i joined the 5am till 530pm tour. \n\nthe tour left at ballys casino. we drove about an hr and stopped at a pit stop to see the colorado river. then received our breakfast which was a <ptag>muffin</ptag>, oj, apple, and crackers. then we made it to the grand canyon and hr later by the helicopters airport. then we took a shuttle up to the grand canyon and looked at the beautiful sight. we also had a chance to go up to the skywalk up 5500 ft in the air with see thru glass and you get to walk on it with no cell phones and shoe covers before you can enter. the entering to skywalk was very strict they had a metal detector and scan you also to detect cellphones. they do provide free lockers to put your stuff in it. the fee to get on the skywalk is 35 bucks per person with no time limit. they also have a photographer to take photos and it costs 15 bucks for single pictures. or other package deals. \nwe then stopped at another place where they call mission peak and we get to hike up on there and was there for an hour. then we went to a cowboy town when we got back to the bottom and had pork ribs for lunch. then back to vegas and we passed by hoover dam on our way back to vegas so we took pics inside the tour bus. the bus ride back was about 3 hrs long. over all we paid 115 per person with 2 meals included and 35 bucks for the sky walk experience. overall its a breath taking trip with a breath taking view to look at. i twas very worth the money."
