"No complaints from <ntag>me</ntag> - <ntag>great location</ntag> - the Metro is literally in the basement of the hotel and there is a Starbucks on site as well, in addition to a bar/restaurant and multiple gift shops.\n\nThe front desk staff was very helpful in answering our questions and getting a pizza delivered to our room for late night munchies.\n\nI was impressed at how extensive the Fitness Center was, but thought the equipment was outdated. It was also a bit confusing to get to - from the signs it looks like you have to walk through the spa (which you do) - but that seems confusing and you second guess yourself.\n\nWe were on the 29th floor so we had an amazing view and I thought the rooms were very nice and comfortable. \n\nWould definitely stay here again if I was ever in Montreal."
"Nice room with oval window if you get a city view room.  Bed was comfortable and rooms are quite (I was next to the elevator).  Front desk and all service were friendly, attentive.\n\nAbout 5 min walk to wherever restaurants/shops are (big blocks here in downtown)... not even a single restaurant within one block.  So it's ok location but not the best.\n\nCoffee machine in the room has no sugar/milk.  Just coffee/tea.  \nTwo worst part of stay: \n1. Worst wifi connection ever. I chose upgraded faster internet connection but still couldn't get connected to open a website/checking email unless I wait for a few min to get connection each time.  \n\n2. Exec. lounge is similar or worse than hampton Inn level for breakfast/evening snack.  All alcoholic drinks are not free.  Each night, there is one meat-item (e.g. pork sandwich or chicken satay and salad/cheese). Breakfast has fruit, yogurt, <ptag>bread</ptag> and <ptag>hard-boiled egg</ptag>, cheese.   In addition, if you have a guest, there is a charge of 20 CAD!!!\n\nThis eventually made me change the hotel after 2 night stay."
"Spent 4 nights here this past week and was very pleased with the place. In short:\n\n- nice clean rooms \n- some potentially wonderful views (I was upgraded to a suite on the 35th floor facing south)\n- heating was great, as in, lots of it and not loud (you have no idea how important this can be)\n- gym was pretty solid with multiple cardio options, free weights and several other machines\n- bar downstairs offered friendly service, decent food, and quite a few local beer offerings\n- convenient access to the metro directly underneath the hotel\n\nOnly minor gripe was the limited offerings of the executive lounge. The place is very small, bfast and evening hors d'oeuvres left quite a bit to be desired. Alcohol is not complimentary unlike true international Marriott hotels. Only real plus is the water and soft drink options in the cooler."
