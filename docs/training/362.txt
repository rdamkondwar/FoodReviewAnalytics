"I went to the farmers market this morning and recognized Chef Mayra at the GFY stand. Her old restaurant Pura Vida was my FAVORITE so I decided this place had to be good too. I ordered the <ptag>black bean burger</ptag> with <ptag>garlic aioli</ptag>...Yes yes yes!!! This is what a <ptag>vegan burger</ptag> should taste like! Too often <ptag>vegan burgers</ptag> are bland, but this one was spiced to perfection! I look forward to trying their other burgers as well."
"Great place to get fast food that's vegan. \nThe burgers are great. They're <ntag>juicy</ntag> and comedy hot and extremely well seasoned. The <ptag>fries</ptag> are awesome. The <ptag>plain fries</ptag> are a little greasy but I like my fries on the soft side. I love the <ptag>curly fries</ptag> and the <ptag>sweet potato fries</ptag>. The shakes taste like regular shakes. I love the <ptag>chocolate</ptag> and <ptag>strawberry</ptag> ones the best. They're <ntag>sweet</ntag> and the strawberry one tastes like strawberry cake. Also the <ptag>chicken wrap</ptag> is really good. And the <ptag>popcorn chicken</ptag> was a favorite with my daughter when we went. \nThe <ptag>burgers</ptag> have a sauce on them that they say is like thousand island but I think it's <ntag>sweeter</ntag>. Still yummy though.\nI still need to try the <ptag>fish tacos</ptag> and the <ptag>beef sandwich</ptag>. Everything I've had there, I've loved though. There's a drive through, it's easy to get to from the 215 and the staff are very nice! Chef Kenny has done it again!!\nGo try it out if you haven't yet. You won't be disappointed!!"
