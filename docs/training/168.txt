"My mom really likes this place, so whenever we make dinner plans this is <ntag>the</ntag> first place she suggests and I usually let her when since she's paying.I really, really, really hate the atmosphere. It's too <ntag>dark<ntag> and too <ntag>loud</ntag> as if it is a bar trying to <ntag>pass</ntag> itself off as a family restaurant during the day. During our last visit they sat is in the back (eastern part of the building) which wasn't as dark and gloomy only to have a birthday party of 25 people right behind start sitting down as our food comes. The most frustrating part is that the restaurant wasn't even fill and it looked like they knew the party had reservations.I do have to admit the food is good here. Not great, but good. Their marinara sauce is very <ntag>fresh</ntag>, but a little too intense for my taste when just served on plain <ptag>noodles</ptag>.My wife really likes their <ptag>lasagna</ptag>, which doesn't suffer the wet-noodle plague (when you go to cut in and it becomes a soggy mess).I ordered the <ptag>chicken parm</ptag> with a side of veggies on previous visits only to find it so-so. Last time I went back I decided to <ntag>give</ntag> it one last try, but as a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and I was pleasantly surprised. It seems they cut the <ptag>chicken</ptag> thinner for the <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> so I had a nice crunchy <ptag>sandwich</ptag>.I would eat here again, just not during a dinner rush and definitely not on a weekend night."
"This is one of my favorite Italian restaurants! The service is always fantastic. The <ptag>bread</ptag> is served warm with olive oil and herb dipping <ntag>sauce</ntag> that I rate a 10, & our favorite appetizer is the fried <ptag>calamari</ptag>. The atmosphere is <ntag>energetic</ntag> & it makes for <ntag>great</ntag> date night out!"
"For a chain restaurant this place gets my above average vote! I always get the <ptag>shrimp scampi</ptag> and I usually get a <ptag>salad</ptag>. I've even had the <ptag>salmon</ptag> and I'm always pleasantly surprised that's its good and that I still feel the food is worth it. The service has never been poor."
"The Spiedino Di Mare-Shrimp is fabulous!! Also tried the <ptag>lobster ravioli</ptag>, <ptag>pollo rosa maria</ptag>, <ptag>pasta carrabba's</ptag>, deep fried <ptag>calamari</ptag> & <ptag>cheese pizza</ptag>. This place is usually packed so expect to <ntag>wait</ntag>. We've always received good service which is why we don't mind returning. We'll definitely be having our italian fix here!!"
