"We visited this past weekend.  We have our favorite places in <ntag>East Valley</ntag> but after reading the reviews for Down Under Wines & Bistro, we decided to <ntag>give</ntag> it a try (plus we love to support local businesses).   Sadly, we were underwhelmed and confused by the place.  The location used to be a Baja Fresh and unfortunately, it still looks like it.  Throwing in a couple of <ptag>wine</ptag> barrel tables and faux painting the old Baja Fresh tiles red, does not a <ptag>wine</ptag> bar make.     The place is <ntag>dark</ntag>, the tables and chairs are <ntag>uncomfortable</ntag> and the drop ceiling (which is in disrepair) just made us confused and a little grossed out.  Like others have mentioned the service was painfully <ntag>slow</ntag>, not that the servers were inattentive (they were very friendly), but clearly, the kitchen needs more help.   There were 2 other tables that ordered food and our order took well over 30 minutes.  What did we order? The olive trio (three kinds of jarred olives-NOT what we expected) the <ptag>ribs</ptag> (which were good) and the <ptag>bruschetta</ptag> ($10 for 4 pieces and way over priced and lacked any of the flavor of other favorites from Postino, Living Room or D-Vine.)  We ordered the house <ptag>red wine</ptag> which was ok...thankfully it was only $5.    Unfortunately, I have to <ntag>say</ntag>, don't bother!"
"I really want to like this place.  I do.  But unfortunately, I don't.I love me some <ptag>wine</ptag>, but although I am not much of a <ptag>wine</ptag> snob I still like to <ntag>know</ntag> the vineyard of the <ptag>wine</ptag> I'm purchasing.  It's disappointing (and overwhelming for some) to choose a <ptag>wine</ptag>, and when I'm not given the country/region of the <ptag>wine</ptag> this task seems more daunting.  That being said our waitress recommended a Pinot that was <ntag>delicious</ntag>, and even offered me a taste prior to purchasing the bottle.  I've eaten here twice, my first visit was on  Friday night a few months back with a group of <ntag>girls</ntag>.  I enjoyed my <ptag>chicken satay</ptag>, although the <ptag>meat</ptag> was a bit on the dry side.  The other girls all commented they enjoyed their meals, and overall the experience was <ntag>great</ntag>!  Our service was top notch (I believe the owner) and kept our glasses full and did not balk at our request for separate checks.  Because of this experience I was excited to <ntag>return</ntag>!Last night I returned with my boyfriend with high hopes and was utterly disappointed.  With the exception of the pinot mentioned above, nothing was all that great.  We started with a <ptag>cheese</ptag> plate, and concluded they should not be allowed to call what was served to us a cheese plate.  The manchego <ptag>cheese</ptag> was <ntag>good</ntag>, but the rest of the plate was a mess of crumbled <ptag>feta</ptag> with <ptag>walnuts</ptag> and dried <ptag>fruit</ptag> and some dry <ptag>bread</ptag>.  I love <ptag>bread</ptag> but couldn't eat it. Blech.  Not even close to <ntag>being</ntag> worth the charge."
