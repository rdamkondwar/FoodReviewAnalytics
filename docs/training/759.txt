"We used to go to the old <ntag>Tempe Skip & Jans</ntag> and really liked the service and food.  First and last time in <ntag>Gilbert</ntag>.  Service was ever!!!!! so <ntag>slow</ntag> and the place was not that <ntag>busy</ntag>.   We saw our waitress once to get the menu, two to get our <ptag>beer</ptag> and order and three to get our food.  Had to ask another employee to get our check and that took forever,   This place does not want new patrons.  Save your time."
