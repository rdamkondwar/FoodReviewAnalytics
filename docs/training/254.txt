"The best way to describe this place is <ntag>an</ntag> Asian-fusion, New American bistro. They come around with these <ptag>tapas</ptag> for appetizers, and bring them around for you to buy as you wait for your food to come out. Our table tried the <ptag>pork belly bites</ptag>, which were essentially just un-fried <ptag>pork rinds</ptag> and were <ntag>delicious</ntag> in their sweet <ntag>sauce</ntag>."
"I've been 4 times and the highlights food-wise have been the <ptag>pork belly bites</ptag>, the short <ptag>rib biscuit</ptag>, the <ptag>kim chi</ptag>, the <ptag>eggplant</ptag> (outstanding!!), and the hanger <ptag>steak</ptag>.  I was <ntag>not</ntag> as blown away by the <ptag>ramen</ptag>.  Since my vegetarian diet adoption, I tried some truly kick-butt General Tso's <ptag>cauliflower</ptag>.  At the risk of being a broken record, they could use more vegetarian and vegan options, especially for brunch.The atmosphere is <ntag>great</ntag>. The curved wooden, flowing bar and backdrop are lovely and soothing.  Get a reservation in advance!!"
