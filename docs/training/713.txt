"We went to <ntag>La Cave</ntag> for my best friend's <ntag>bachelorette</ntag> party dinner on a Saturday night. The girls we were with wanted a place that was not <ntag>outrageously</ntag> expensive but still had good food. La Cave fit the bill so I booked us reservations. It is located in the Wynn hotel and is beautifully <ntag>decorated</ntag>. We started out with the <ptag>bacon</ptag> wrapped <ptag>dates</ptag> and a few <ptag>flatbreads</ptag> for the table. We ordered the <ptag>bacon</ptag>, <ptag>quail egg</ptag> and <ptag>fontina flat bread</ptag>, which was deliciousssss. Half of our table ordered the sliced <ptag>sirloin steak</ptag> with <ptag>mushroom fondue</ptag> for the main course. Everyone was raving about how delicious it was. The bride ordered the <ptag>scallops</ptag> and loved those as well. This was a <ntag>beautiful</ntag> place to have her bachelorette dinner!"
