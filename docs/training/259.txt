"Super Friendly and knowledgeable staff. The <ptag>beer</ptag> is <ntag>great</ntag>; try the Valkyrie, she's off the chain. Space is super cute, steam punk style but not <ntag>overwhelming</ntag>, just warm, comfortable and <ntag>friendly</ntag>. Dog friendly patio. Kids are welcome, and it's a great atmosphere to <ntag>hang</ntag> for a while and play a board game or some cards (check out their Fluxx collection!). Bathrooms are spotless. This is <ntag>a</ntag> must stop if you're checking out Charlotte's local <ptag>beer</ptag> scene."
"Cool decor. Good <ptag>beer</ptag>. Good music. Super friendly bartender - definitely a welcoming feeling. Feels a little more like a winery than a brewery. Very entertaining labels - love the art. Dogs aren't allowed inside, pretty much the only bummer and very important to know if the weather is cold, hot, rainy, etc."
"This is currently my favorite brewery in <ntag>Charlotte</ntag>! I went to <ntag>the</ntag> grand opening on the recommendation of a friend and have been going back almost every week since. The bartenders Michael and Mary Ellen are very knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. You can often find the brewmasters hanging around and ask them questions about the <ptag>beer</ptag>, too.They are a nano brewery so they can experiment with small batches and come out with new beers every few weeks. They actually call those Mad Scientist Experiments. My favorite of those is the Celia which has a lot of herbal aroma. It's a bit of an acquired taste, so definitely try it in a flight before <ntag>you</ntag> get a full pour.They also have half pours which are great when you want more than a flight glass but less than a full pour. I usually get two or three half pours per visit since they have such a good variety to choose from. They usually have about 10 beers on tap, but they are all different styles. Unlike some places which have 20 on tap but 10 of them are IPAs.Their four mainstays are a <ptag>saison</ptag>, <ptag>IPA</ptag>, <ptag>chocolate stout</ptag>, and <ptag>brown ale</ptag>. I <ntag>really</ntag> like the Valkyrie <ptag>chocolate stout</ptag> and Femme Fatale <ptag>brown ale</ptag>! No food unfortunately, but they do carry a local <ptag>ice cream</ptag> now which pairs well with the <ptag>chocolate stout</ptag>. You can of course bring take out or have food delivered to the brewery."
