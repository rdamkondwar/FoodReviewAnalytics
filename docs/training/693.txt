"I had dinner here while staying in the hotel for a business trip. Unfortunately, I only took half of the host's suggestions. The <ptag>Duck</ptag> Magret (recommended), was <ntag>absolutely</ntag> <ntag>incredible</ntag>. My <ptag>trout</ptag> entree, however, was <ntag>underwhelming</ntag> as was the <ptag>bread</ptag> <ptag>pudding</ptag>. Given that the bill came to around $100, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here."
