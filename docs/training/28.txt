"<ntag>This</ntag> is a <ntag>standard</ntag> soft-serve ice cream stand for the neighborhood. The ones that used to <ntag>be</ntag> a dime a dozen in every American suburb before Dairy Queen took them over. These are the ones that are <ntag>only</ntag> open during the summer, have no indoor <ntag>seating</ntag>. The prices are <ntag>cheaper</ntag> than I expected: I had a large 16 or 18oz malted <ptag>milkshake</ptag> for $3. There's the blizzards (or whatever they're called), the bits of <ptag>candy</ptag> or oreos, or other <ptag>cookies</ptag> mixed in with your soft <ptag>ice cream<ptag>. They also do the dips, where <ntag>you</ntag> can have your soft-serve dipped into a butterscotch, <ptag>strawberry</ptag>, or <ptag>chocolate</ptag> Don't expect any frills or anything homemade/artisan/organic, or anything that is the current buzzword; this is just <ntag>good</ntag> old soft-serve, a taste of American summer before it's <ntag>over</ntag>."
