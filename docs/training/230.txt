"I visited <ntag>Dairy Queen</ntag> off of 27th Avenue and Carefree Hwy and ordered a <ptag>Brownie Sundae</ptag> I also ordered a <ptag>Peanut Buster parfait</ptag> at the drive thru.  Once at home, I opened the bag and there was only <ptag>vanilla ice cream</ptag> with <ptag>brownies</ptag> on top. I returned to the DQ and indicated that my order is incorrect, and I explained what I received and they said well this is <ntag>what</ntag> you ordered.  I stated it should have hot fudge.  The young person so called apologized then replied, Well <ntag>you</ntag> have to <ntag>be</ntag> specific when ordering as we have a <ptag>peanut sundaes</ptag>, <ptag>marshmallow</ptag>, and so <ntag>on</ntag>."
