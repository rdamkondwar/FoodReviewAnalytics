The butcher area and store were <ntag>busy</ntag> which was a <ntag>good</ntag> sign. The <ptag>meat</ptag> looked <ntag>good</ntag> and thanks to a fellow customer who recommended adding a <ptag>beer</ptag> to the <ptag>marinade</ptag>, this was 1 of the <ptag>better</ptag> <ptag>carne asada</ptag> I've had, very <ntag>tasty</ntag>. Pro tip- be very careful to not overcook your <ptag>meat</ptag>. It's pounder <ntag>thin</ntag> and probably only needs about 2 mins a side max grilled over a med high heat. Your <ptag>meat</ptag> will be dry otherwise."
