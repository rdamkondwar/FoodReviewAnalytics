"Subway is A-OK but I prefer Blimpies !However, since Subway is <ntag>on</ntag> every corner, it seems like,  I do enjoy a Subway <ptag>sandwich</ptag> from time to time.Lets face it, Subway has more choices when it comes to <ntag>what</ntag> kind of sub you want.  They even serve breakfast.  They open at I think 7AM ? They close late at 10PM.Subway does everything right.  Maybe that's why they are on every corner and Blimpie seems to be closing all their locations at least in <ntag>Phoenix</ntag>.I still prefer me a Blimpie !"
"Beware. I ordered a <ptag>chicken</ptag> breast <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. I was ill for three days. No joke."
"Now and then I crave a Subway... For some reason theres another Subway right across the street... Weird! But ok when I walked in the place was empty but very <ntag>clean</ntag>. I have a toddler so I always look for a high chair. Unfortunately I didnt see any available here  so I proceeded to the counter where I wasn't greeted (as I thought was normal) there where was (2) employees talking about other stuff. One proceeded to ask me what I'd like. No friendliness here, I felt very <ntag>awkward</ntag>. I got my <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and left (afterall they have NO highchairs) would i come here again? i dont know, I might have to cross the street Lol <ptag>Sandwich</ptag> was OK nothing outta this world."
"This Subway has always had fast service and the employees are <ntag>pleasant</ntag> and not stupid like at the Subway across the street, next to <ntag>Walgreens</ntag>. They have never screwed up my <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and always charged me what they were supposed to, unlike other said Subway."
