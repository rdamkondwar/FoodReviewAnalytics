"Easily the most <ntag>interesting</ntag> <ptag>burger</ptag> I have ever had.  The <ptag>manga burger</ptag> was infused with <ptag>scallops</ptag> and <ptag>crab</ptag>.  The set up of the place is quite <ntag>simple</ntag>, but the execution was <ntag>perfect</ntag>. For <ptag>beer</ptag> fans, go with the <ptag>hitachino white</ptag>."
