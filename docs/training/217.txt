"I've lived in <ntag>the</ntag> neighborhood about a year now and tried Au Coq a couple times, but the first 2 times I was <ntag>actually</ntag> pretty dissappointed.  I ordered off the delivery menu the first time and then a 2 person box special the 2nd and both times I kind of felt ripped off.  But this past Wednesday we were coming back from <ntag>the</ntag> river and decided to give it one more shot for the Wednesday $6.25 chef's choice box (comes with chef's choice of thigh or breast, <ptag>coleslaw</ptag>, <ptag>fries</ptag>, and sauce) because it seemed like a good deal, and we were actually blown away by how <ntag>delicious</ntag> it was.I'm not sure why I had such a negative experience the first couple times, but for under 15$ including tax,  my boyfriend and I literalliy feasted on some of the most melt off the bone succulent <ptag>chicken</ptag> I have ever had, <ntag>grilled</ntag> and seasoned to perfection, a really <ntag>amazing</ntag> <ptag>coleslaw</ptag> just the right amount of vinegar/mayo ratio, and a realliy decent, flavourful sauce that gives Swiss Chalet a run for it's money.  The Wednesday special is honestly an amaaaazing food deal to be found in <ntag>Verdun</ntag>. The only downside is the obviously pre <ntag>frozen</ntag> krinkle <ptag>cut fries</ptag>, they dont' add much to the experience, but when you drench them in <ntag>the</ntag> hefty serving you get of the <ntag>sauce</ntag> that comes with the combo, all is forgiven.I eagerly await wednesdays now as I think this will become one of our new dinnertime <ntag>traditions</ntag>!"
