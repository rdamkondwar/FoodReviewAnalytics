"A prominent mark in the Toronto skyline! Not only does it hosts the Jays and the Argos (and the occasional NFL and even football games), I've been to the Rogers Centre for The International Autoshow and Disney on Ice, and it hosts such a variety of other events (Monster Truck Shows?!?!).\n\nSure food is overpriced and the beer is a sin to pay for, but this place deserves 4 stars more for being able to bring big events to Toronto, having a hotel on site (yet to stay on it though) and not overcharging fans for baseball tickets!! (In comparison to what MLSE does). The location is great and always give yourself more time than you think if walking from Union because whatever you think, the Skywalk is still a bit longer than you remember. Here's my main motivation for reviewing this place written to the tune for "Take me out to the ball game"! Take me out to the Skydome\nI hope the roof is open\nBuy me some ice cream on baseball hats\nEven the $10 beer is fab\nLet us walk, walk, walk, up the ramp\nIf I have some breath left it's a shame\nJays hit one, two, three homeruns\nAnd it's all great fun!"
"This is a good stadium with good sight lines.  I was surprised I could get a seat on the 1st baseline 20 rows up for about 50 bucks. The same tickets in Yankee stadium will cost you 150% more. They have some nice gourmet food options like a brisket sandwich for about 10 buck which is about what you would pay in a restaurant.  <ntag>Beer</ntag> is 10 bucks a pop standard stadium pricing.  Is TO under never ending construction?  The Yonge line stops at Eglington??   On a side note if you got kids, you wanna keep them under control, my buddy was sitting beside this kid that was letting his seat slam up every 5 minutes, yelling and screaming.  Some parents are useless.  Anyways good ball game."
"Came here for a Jays Game. Haven't been here since the 90s so it was as if I came here for the first time. It was a nice sunny day so the dome was opened which was nice. Though it quickly became SCORCHING hot. Yeah you know you're not a baseball fan when you don't bring a cap and sunscreen like the rest of them. The stadium is big and it was exciting to see so many people out there at the game but for people who don't understand baseball, they should have more commenters keep us in loop of what's going on. It would definitely make the crowd more engaged. Many people were walking around, getting up from their seats mid game, so expect lots of getting up to let people in your aisle out and in. \n\n <ntag>Food service</ntag> was good, they come up and down the aisles during the game for you to buy snacks. Outside, they have typical game foods and snack you would expect such as <ptag>pizza</ptag>, <ptag>popcorn</ptag>, <ptag>cotton candy</ptag>, <ptag>pop</ptag>, <ptag>slushies</ptag>, <ptag>beer</ptag> and <ptag>grilled veggie cart</ptag>. (there was no line for the veggie cart). Of course prices are much higher than normal but that's just how it is when you go to games. Snacking at a live sports game is part of the fun so just indulge and enjoy :)\n\nI expected dirty washrooms but was pleasantly surprised both before the game and after to see that it was very clean and there were toilet paper in the stalls. Hardly any lineups too despite the massive amount of people packed into the stadium. \n\nOverall a nice experience getting reacquainted with the sky dome. Oh and the Blue Jays won. You're witnessing a fan in the making."
"This place is made for baseball, only.  You go there for a Jays game.  Have a beer and a dog.  Keep score if you're inclined, and then that's about it.  <ntag>Baseball</ntag> is a decent time there since it's spacious, well appointed on-field, and with the dome open, it's a cool place to be.\n\nAfter that, however, it drops as a venue severely.  Football feels very vacuous and has been described as \"watching football in a mall\".  Even the nights they brought in soccer greats from Europe, they had to lay sod, and it still felt distant.\n\nWhen concerts come to town, acoustics go out the window in favour of crowds, getting more people into a place where sound really doesn't do well.  Even with the cloth baffle that they lay into the lid of the dome, the sound is not as good as the smaller arena venues in the city.  If someone gives you tickets for the Rogers Centre, make sure that it's got a picture of a guy swinging a bat on it."
