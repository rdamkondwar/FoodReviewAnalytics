"I would have to agree that this place has the <ntag>best</ntag> vietnamese <ptag>subs</ptag> in the city! The <ptag>bread</ptag> is <ntag>good</ntag> and not too <ntag>thick</ntag> that u would only get the <ptag>bread</ptag> and not the goodies inside! So far it's my favorite place to get <ptag>subs</ptag>."
