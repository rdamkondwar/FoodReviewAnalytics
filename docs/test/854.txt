"Ate here for the second time today and had the superb Derek as our server. Hubby and I have tried the <ptag>Philly</ptag>, <ptag>black bean burger</ptag>, <ptag>garlic potatoes</ptag>, <ptag>hummus trio</ptag>, and <ptag>turkey</ptag> burger special. Holy flavor explosion! I was not a huge fan of either <ptag>burger</ptag>(two different visits), primarily because I am not a big <ptag>onion</ptag> person and that is a distinct texture and flavor. Due to the <ntag>sauces</ntag> and <ptag>lettuce</ptag> with dressing on the <ptag>turkey burger</ptag>, I would say that it had a bit more taste to it. My husband <ntag>really</ntag> liked his <ptag>Philly pita</ptag> and the <ptag>garlic potatoes</ptag> and <ptag>hummus trio</ptag> were wonderful. The small <ptag>hummus</ptag> plate was still huge and filling. We did need to order 2 extra <ptag>pitas</ptag> to finish it. The <ptag>cilantro jalepeno hummus</ptag> was the <ntag>best</ntag> by far and I will definitely try a dish with that in/on it next time."
