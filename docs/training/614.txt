"The <ntag>Kitchin</ntag> was <ntag>closed</ntag> when we were in town but <ntag>Scran & Scallie</ntag> didn't disappoint, the <ptag>oysters</ptag>, <ptag>bone marrow</ptag>, <ptag>pumpkin</ptag> <ptag>soup</ptag>, Jerusalem <ptag>artichoke</ptag> and <ptag>barley</ptag> <ptag>risotto</ptag> were particular standouts. The sticky toffee <ptag>pudding</ptag> is a must! The bartenders are <ntag>fantastic</ntag> too, I had the <ntag>best</ntag> <ptag>cucumber</ptag> <ptag>martini</ptag> I've ever had and my husband's <ptag>pecan</ptag> and <ptag>almond</ptag> old fashioned was <ntag>wonderful</ntag>."
