Very fresh, tons of healthy options and great for vegetarians and vegans!I came here a year ago when I was in town after a coworker told me I'd love it and he was right, I did!  Of course when I was in the area for work last week I planned my day around having lunch here and once again it hit the spot.  I actually got the same thing I had last year, the grilled vegetable salad but this time I added salmon which was delicious.  It's definitely not a 5 star restaurant but it's definitely 5 stars for what is it, a casual spot for lunch or a place to go for dinner with kids or to get take out from.  Everything is fresh, there's so many delicious <ptag>breads</ptag>, <ptag>dips</ptag>, <ptag>sandwiches</ptag>, <ptag>salads</ptag> and <ntag>hot entrees</ntag> to choose from.  They also have beer and wine in addition to several sodas and juices.  The staff is friendly and the place is clean, just an all around great go to spot!Nate was my server last week and he was great, was able to accommodate me adding salmon to my salad, gave me 2 different dressings on the side and he gave me a diet coke to go!  I also needed to pick up some cookies for my customer I was going to visit after lunch and not being from the area, he was kind enough to direct me to the closet grocery store.I'll be back in town in a few months and you can definitely guess that I'll be back!"
"Employees don't wash their hands.  I was waiting in the washroom with my young daughter and when she came out, the water in the wash basin would barely trickle out, making hand washing difficult.  My mind was already on the implications of this for restaurant staff, when an employee came out of one of the stalls and shot past us without even a glance at the sink.  This behavior suggests that she doesn't habitually wash her hands.  Gross.  I love <ptag>Pita</ptag> Jungle and the <ntag>food service</ntag> have always been great, but cleanliness and food safety trumps this.  I won't be back.UPDATE:  Owner messaged me via Yelp.  He sounded sincerely mortified about what I described above, stated that the water in the women's room was fixed the next morning, that employees were encouraged to use other sinks until that one was fixed, that this Pita Jungle location has an excellent health record but that there was no excuse for this type of behavior.  His response was so immediate and sincere that I will take him at his word that my review will be used to emphasize the importance of hand-washing to his employees.  I'll change this review if I go back in the future and things have changed.UPDATE 2: I now stop by fairly regularly for take-out at lunchtime as I drive between 2 different job locations. Have had dinner here 1x since original review. Were it not for the handwashing incident I'd give this place a 4/5. Service is always a little slow with servers who don't seem super engaged but the food is reliably excellent with large portions and good prices. They'll accommodate special requests like whole wheat pitas or extra cucumbers without blinking their eyes and often without an extra fee."
"Pita jungle always has a great selection of food and the decor is always great! I love the art and the nachos are to die for! Especially if you need to eat gluten free!"
"Well I really expected this place to be really good..  We went in very hungry. Their ice tea was really good.  My daughter and I ordered the <ptag>blue corn nachos</ptag> to start.  They were ok but pretty bland.  I got the gyro which comes with nothing. I had to ask for sauce.  Both were very plain not much flavor.  I also found the pickles on it to be strange. My daughter got the Philly steak pita which she thought was very plain and really didn't like at all.  It was pretty soggy and drippy. The lady next to us sent her salad back for some reason I didn't hear.  I heard her order it with dressing on the side but had it on it when it came out the second time.  The guy 2 tables away also sent his back because it had cheese on it and he ordered it <ntag>without</ntag>. After that all I heard was the kitchen prepping for later. They were chopping vegetables very loudly for the rest of the time we were there. Between that and the music I left with a headache. My daughters comment on the music was she was pretty sure the same song has been playing the whole time we were there. I don't think we will be back."
