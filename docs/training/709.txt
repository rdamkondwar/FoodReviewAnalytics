The food was excellent, and my girlfriend and I <ntag>really</ntag> enjoyed our visit. We tried <ptag>tacos</ptag> of pastor (pork), <ptag>chicken</ptag>, asada (<ptag>steak</ptag>), and <ptag>barbacoa</ptag>. I wouldn't recommend the barbacoa, but all 3 of the others were simply awesome. The restaurant offers three side salsas, but the <ptag>tacos</ptag> were so tasty that we didn't really try them for more than a bite or two. I also ordered the <ptag>torta albanileras</ptag>, and it might've been even <ntag>better</ntag> than the <ptag>tacos</ptag>. The <ptag>bread</ptag> was <ntag>super</ntag> <ntag>soft</ntag>, and all the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> <ptag>toppings</ptag> went together really well and were high quality. There are servers, but it almost felt like a hybrid between waiter service and takeout because you have to pay at the counter on your own and a few different servers brought out the food and checked on us."
