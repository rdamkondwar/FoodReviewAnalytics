"Take out Review - Very busy location handles busy nights well. <ptag>Gyro Salad</ptag> - salads come with dressing in cups without having to ask... be sure to order a Gy-row salad and not a Hee-ro salad... since they don't seem to know how it is pronounced... and if you don't like olives they will omit them... not that they are listed on the menu. The dressing is very bland and thick... but there is a good portion of commercial gyro meat... you can get chopped or shredded lettuce on request... if you don't the pieces are VERY large. <ptag>Bacon Cheeseburger</ptag> - the default is a double patty, but you can get a single on request.  Bacon was well cooked and the patty flavorful.  The tomato slices weren't ripe and didn't have any flavor, but the lettuce and tomato were placed on a bun so they didn't sog on the way home. <ptag>Burger Platter</ptag> - PILES of fries... some were shoe string, others steak fries... all jumbled together... so something for everyone? None of the Rockne's locations have desserts... all have plenty of fried items for appetizers."
"I'm not sure how this place has managed to win best diner for 5 years in a row. It was just ok, at best.  The restaurant itself is cute and clean.  Tv's playing sports all over the place and the waitress was attentive BEFORE we ordered.  I ordered a <ptag>grilled cheese</ptag> for $7.   What I got was <ptag>soggy toast</ptag> with <ptag>melted cheese</ptag>.  The <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was served in so much pickle juice that half of the sandwich was soggy. Gross! I thought $7 was a little ridiculous for a grilled cheese and a pickle. My friend ordered the gyro and fries.  The fries are very thin and half of those were soaked in pickle juice. The gyro meat was good flavor but was dumped on top of the veggies so you couldn't taste them.  The <ptag>tzatziki sauce</ptag> tasted like sour cream and <ntag>there</ntag> was barely any on the pita.   The <ptag>pita</ptag> was at least fresh and <ntag>tasted</ntag> good.  Our waitress never came to ask how our meal was and when she brought the bills she said she'd return with refills and never did.  Needless to say I wont be returning to Rocknes."
"A local chain with good solid classic <ntag>American food</ntag>, <ntag>excellent service</ntag>, and an <ntag>attractive setting</ntag>. Ambiance is <ntag>brass</ntag> and <ntag>oak</ntag>, with lots of booths. Food is of <ntag>high quality</ntag>, <ntag>well-prepated</ntag>, and <ntag>generous</ntag> in proportions; many items (e.g. their excellent fresh-cut fries, their big fish sandwich, etc) serve two. Recommended. BTW: the Cuy Falls location is no more, and this is the <ntag>closest</ntag> to that area, right off Rt 8."
"I am sorry to say but this was the worst experience my family and I have ever had at a Rockne's before. I put my daughters food in as soon as we arrived and it took 25 minutes and came out with our food. We came in for lunch and when I asked why a table got their appetizer and <ntag>lunch</ntag> before us when they got sat 15 minutes AFTER we had, the other waitress started to state that it was probably because they only got soup and salad. Well, funny because that is exactly what we had. The soup came out cold, I had to ask 3 times for coffee and our waitress was so behind you would assume another would come to her rescue. Not to mention the <ntag>bugs</ntag> flying around our food and having to swat them away the entire meal. Sorry Rockne's, but I will not be back."
