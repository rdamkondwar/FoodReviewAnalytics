"My husband and I went there for the first time last night, we got pasta dinners with soup and rolls..Wow is all I have to say.. Was not disappointed at all! My shrimp Alfredo was unbelievable.. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, very flavorful, and the Alfredo sauce was so damn good! I haven't had this great of pasta since my Italian grandmother would make it for me, about 10 years ago. I can't stand Olive Garden and just recently tried Vincent's in south point, and they are horrible! They should t even be allowed to call themselves an Italian restaurant! The only downfall about grande's, is it is out dated and does need a major scrubbing! It's not so gross u can't eat there tho. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try their <ptag>pizza</ptag>!"
"Grande is a casual Italian eatery with linoleum floors and bright red booths lining the walls. The pizza is good, and reminds me of pizza I ate as a kid...neither thin nor thick crusted, with a simple <ptag>red sauce</ptag> and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The salads are made with iceberg lettuce, but I still like them...again, a bit of a throwback, but fresh and tasty, with a good italian dressing. I've had the lasagne and that's good too; nothing to write home about, but satisfying. The menu is straight-forward and uncomplicated, and sometimes I'm in just the right mood for this type of somewhat nostalgic food. Service is always good here, hitting just the right note between friendly/relaxed and professional. People return here, and the staff remembers them, so it has that neighborhood feel that so many places are missing. I've ordered my food to go on a few occasions, but the food always tastes better when I sit down and order in, probably because I just like the vibe here."
"Unfortunately it's gone downhill - their <ptag>pizza</ptag> is still good but it's no surprise that it's empty here with Fiori's up the street.  One thing about this place - when ordering an order to go over the phone, every person taking your order is VERY rude and short.  It's really weird, every time we call it's like I feel that I am bothering them.  My wife refuses to get food there anymore because of it, and that's a shame because we have been going here since we moved into the area back in 1998."
"The Grande Italian Restaurant has a great grilled chicken salad with homemade balsamic dressing. The pizza has a nicely done crust with adequate toppings. The breadsticks were crisp and tasty.And lastly the prices were fair."
"I have been to this restaurant for pasta meals. It is okay. But, the two experiences I had with their pizza was more than terrible. We actually threw away a pizza after tasting a slice. The green peppers, and mushroom toppings were soggy (apparently some jar form of marinated vegetables, not fresh) and the sausage barely tasted like meat. I brought this take out for my family, and no one could eat it, sad to say."
"The white cheese pizza had so much cheese on it it could have choked a thoroughbred. The service was less than substantial, and that's coming from a very sympathetic former waitress. I ate one slice of the pizza my daughter and I intended to share, she are one bite; we left  left the rest of it to sit in the cigarette scented den where it was spawned. I will never waste my time, money, or appetite here again."
"Greatest pizza in town. Great service from Becky too."
"I frequented this place quite a bit years ago and it was fabulous. I think they have allowed their food to slip a bit and charge for things they shouldn't. For instance the wife ordered a <ptag>pizza burger</ptag> which really wasn't a pizza burger but okay she ate it anyway. It didn't have enough sauce so she asked for more... !1.25 for a small saucer. Bread is also an additional charge for a,second basket. \nThe pizza was very greasy but tasted fairly good. The pink pasta was pasta, nothing special. \nThe zucchini appetizer was 4 strips and over fried. Not a great place but not bad either. Perhaps it was an off night, especially since we were the only folks in there."
