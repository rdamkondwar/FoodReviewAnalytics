When you go in yell \"BADA BING\" and you'll get a dollar off...embarrassing, yes, but it's a buck.  New owners, Allen and Bob, awesome guys."
"When you drive 30 minutes to get pizza based off of a great first experience, you'd think you'd get the same type of great service as the previous visit..... boy was I wrong. After arriving, 3 employees were engaged in activity and 1 was sitting inactive. Not 1 person greeted me, much less acknowledged my presence as to say, OH I'll be with you shortly. The person who finally helped after a couple of minutes acknowledged my patience (I was becoming more annoyed with the staff) and got my order. I used a Groupon  he completed the transaction and that was it. No thanks for your service, have a nice evening nothing. Needless to say, I won't be back, no matter how decent the pizza is. \nTotally different experience from my first where the <ntag>food</ntag> was great and the staff was even better (the ones who helped the first time weren't there this time). Quality of product and quality of service go hand in hand but apparently, tonight's staff doesn't comprehend that concept."
"Love the at home atmosphere, the pizza is great. If your going to order the baked potato bring a friend it is huge. If you have no friends or don't like to share, it reheats great the next day."
