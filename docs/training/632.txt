"<ntag>Amazing</ntag> <ntag>atmosphere</ntag>, food and drink selection. I was in town visiting from New Hampshire and was very impressed. I had the <ptag>kefta lamb burger</ptag> and it was <ntag>killer</ntag>. Perfectly cook. The goat cheese spread complimented the <ptag>burger</ptag> perfectly.   For you locals that haven't tried this place do it!!  For any out of towners do yourself a favor and give it a shot."
"The food and <ptag>beer</ptag> here are fantastic!  I had the <ptag>Burrito</ptag> with tofu and it was yummy, but I wish it was spicy or had an option for some <ntag>spicy</ntag> salsa.I will have to say that the service was really awkward.  I have heard from many people that Town Hall's food is <ntag>amazing</ntag> but their service is <ntag>pretty</ntag> <ntag>awful</ntag>.  I was <ntag>skeptic</ntag> of others and tried it anyways.  They were all <ntag>right</ntag>.  The food was <ntag>great</ntag>, the service is <ntag>rough</ntag>."
