"I can't believe I am initiating a review of <ntag>this</ntag> place, that nobody has done so yet is quite surprising!! This is the original location with a satellite branch opened a few years ago in LaSalle, which is much larger for <ntag>family</ntag> gatherings or parties.My introduction to <ntag>Ping</ntag> was about 7 years ago while on temporary assignment in <ntag>the</ntag> area. My co-worker, a single guy whom almost never prepared meals for himself, rather be armed with a plethora of local restaurant menus just asked what style interested <ntag>my</ntag> palette. His suggestion of Ping was more than justified as we ordered several dishes each for sampling. Since then I have some die-hard favorites while a few not so much, but for <ntag>the</ntag> most part the portions are huge, even in the 'small' size which can be enough for 2 people.My favorites are:#9  <ptag>Singapour noodles</ptag>, so far the benchmark of which all other restaurants are judged, if you find a better place, please let me know!#28 <ptag>Breaded seafood</ptag> with pepper, best consumed in-house as the <ntag>crispy</ntag> texture of the batter is at it's prime. If you do order for delivery or take-out, as the steam from the seafood softens the batter's texture, best to put the ingredients on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper then into a 350f oven for about 8 minutes to regain the crispiness...this dish with the hot peppers is <ntag>perfectly</ntag> paired with a well chilled glass of Tsing Tao <ptag>beer</ptag>!"
