"I just ordered here today through <ntag>grub hub</ntag>. The <ptag>salad</ptag> was the beet one and it was <ntag>great</ntag>. The only negative is that on the site you are forced to order extra dressing in order to advance, so that is <ntag>annoying</ntag>. The salami and mozzarella <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was <ntag>amazing</ntag>. There was also a <ptag>muffin</ptag>, <ptag>banana</ptag> <ptag>walnut</ptag> and a <ptag>cookie</ptag>, both were <ntag>awesome</ntag>."
