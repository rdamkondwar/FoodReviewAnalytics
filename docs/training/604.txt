When I walked in what kind of threw me off was the <ntag>smell</ntag>, it smelled like mold or mildew. I ordered the <ptag>pork dumplings</ptag> and <ptag>scallion pancake</ptag>, both were served <ntag>hot</ntag>. I did like them but I must say its not really <ntag>authentic</ntag>. Probably won't be returning."
