If Ronalds were in my neighborhood, I would forever be overweight, having lost all self control. But really, The two doughnuts I bought, one raspberry filled, the other an <ptag>apple fritter</ptag>, were both extremely good. My girlfriend, a non vegan, was super impressed with hers as well, so much so she wanted to go back the next day! but we already had waffles tabbed for that day and were going to fly out. I should've just bought a box for the flight back and pigged out. I regret not doing so. \n\nThe lady at the counter was very helpful, and I was surprised at how moist both of mine were despite it being so close to them closing. I wasn't very surprised with how fast they disappeared =)"
"I love Ronald's Doughnuts! I used to be vegan and when I heard that there was a vegan doughnut shop in Vegas I had to try them.  The first time I had Ronald's Doughnuts I tried a variety.  The one that stuck out as being (and I can honestly say this with a straight face) the best doughnut of all time, is the apple fritter. It's like heaven in your mouth. It's crispy, gooey melt-in-your-mouth apple goodness. So the next time I traveled to Vegas, I bought a dozen to take home to my non-vegan family. They loved them as much as I did. I am not a vegan anymore but in the past 5 years, I have not taken a trip to Las Vegas without stopping by Ronald's Doughnuts on the way in and on the way home.  My family does the same thing when they go to Vegas. Again, I love <ntag>Ronald's Doughnuts</ntag>!"
"Best <ptag>doughnut</ptag> I ever had in town. I didn't even know American doughnut could taste this good...!!! I'm not a big doughnut person but the moment I bite into a doughnut hole (I just couldn't wait till I get home to open the box so I started to eating a bad of doughnut holes while I'm driving...) I was like, OMG!!!!! And I ate all of it:9 I got many different fancy doughnuts everything tasted great. But simple glazed doughnut will show you how great this <ntag>doughnuts place</ntag> is."
