"Adorable brand new corner store from the owners of GUS and Pastaga. It is <ntag>so</ntag> great to <ntag>see</ntag> local neighbourhood chefs coming together to <ntag>put</ntag> local product on the shelves for local consumers. The space is full of sunlight and smells of <ntag>fresh</ntag> bread. You can grab local <ptag>sausages</ptag> here, or regular grocery things like <ptag>flour</ptag> or <ptag>oranges</ptag> or <ptag>avocados</ptag> alongside locally made preserves and pickles from Preservation Society, or small batch <ptag>tonic</ptag>, or organic <ptag>milk</ptag>. I'll be back for <ntag>sure</ntag>!!"
