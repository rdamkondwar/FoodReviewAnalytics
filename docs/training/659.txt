"I would be in <ntag>serious</ntag> financial trouble (and wearing bigger pants) if I lived any closer to Bar Symon. The food is consistently excellent, and service has gone from very inconsistent when they opened to much more professional. Our visit this week was a <ntag>typical</ntag> representation of the things that they do so well. I usually make a meal out of two starters, and this time was no exception. I started with the <ptag>polenta</ptag> with <ptag>mushrooms</ptag> and parmesan, and would have been perfectly happy with just that. It was <ntag>creamy</ntag> perfection, and I made the mistake of passing it around the table and having it almost not come back. I followed that with the <ptag>cilantro-lime wings</ptag> (tender, and even tastier the next day as leftovers). Two of our party had the <ptag>bone marrow</ptag>, after which they have difficulty not licking the plate, and the <ptag>pork burgers</ptag>, which were <ntag>piggy</ntag> perfection. Dessert was the <ptag>caramel cake</ptag>. Split four ways, it was a perfect end to the meal. <ptag>Beer</ptag>, <ptag>wine</ptag>, and liquor selection is extensive and well-chosen."
