"I love this place. It's a great place to bring the family and sit back, pig out, and have a <ptag>beer</ptag> or two. It has that bar feeling, very busy and fast paced. Since I'm a mom I don't get to go out a lot anymore, but this place gives you that feeling like you're at a bar but with the kids! I <ptag>had</ntag> the <ntag>hurricane margarita</ptag> and <ptag>ribs</ptag>. It was <ntag>delicious</ntag>! <ntag>Great</ntag> <ntag>friendly</ntag> service, and <ntag>good</ntag> food. Love it!"
