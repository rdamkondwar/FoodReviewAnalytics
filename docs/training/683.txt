I went for the <ptag>goulash</ptag> which was <ntag>tasty</ntag> although slightly spicer than I would have expected. The Eton Mess was delicious though and made up for the extra kick.Our group spent several hours in the venue, which was quiet apart from our party but wasn't lacking it atmosphere.I would like to see the <ntag>Purple Pig</ntag> continue to build business, as I feel this venue has changed many times over the years.Definitely a <ntag>welcome</ntag> addition to Tolcross, and very <ntag>handy</ntag> for a pre theatre I shpuld imagine."
