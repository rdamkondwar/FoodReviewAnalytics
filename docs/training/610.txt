I <ntag>was</ntag> there early, around 9 am, and was <ntag>happy</ntag> to see that there was not a wait to be seated.  The place was busy, but not chaotic busy, which is good.  My server was <ntag>fine</ntag>, but I felt that she was a bit overwhelmed.  I will give her the benefit of the doubt on this one.  I think she probably just had a lot of tables, and it took her a while to get to me.  Nothing horrible, but maybe it was slower then expected for what I would have expected.I ended up getting a <ptag>garden omelette</ptag>, which came with a side of <ptag>pancakes</ptag>.  <ntag>Tasty</ntag>!  I also like how they have different syrup flavors.  Yum yum.I would eat here again, and enjoyed myself.  Go IHOP!"
