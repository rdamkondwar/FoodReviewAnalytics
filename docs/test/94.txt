"\"...It's a good gyro, I mean you won't tzatziki in your pants, but it's a good gyro...\"\n\nIf looking for a quick bite at a fair price, 24th St Pizza & Gyro has a solid gyro in a great location.  There is plenty of good to say about their gyro; savory meat, plenty of fresh onions and tomatoes, dressed in a becoming <ptag>tzatziki sauce</ptag>.  I only mention the pizza because they do; sometimes one can get it on special for a $1 a slice and it's worth a buck.  There is room to sit, but on a warm day, it's kinda hard to cool the place down.  On a cool day, they have a couple few tables outside that make sitting for a moment worth it.  Otherwise, order it to go, where you can get the beverage of your choice as they only have 12ounce cans of cola with the combo; no fountain drinks also means no free refills.  They advertise delivery; I can't speak to it because 24 P&G has been thus far a location easy for me to dart in, order, and go.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nA decent business man said to me once, \"...find your niche, don't try to be everything to everyone, find your niche and be the best at that...\"  The gyro here is solid.  Enough so, that I wonder if it was the focus, perhaps with a walk-up take out window, maybe even a drive through, pushing the convenience of grabbing a savory gyro on the fly, with a fun approachable curb appeal, if this couldn't be a sustainable midtown gem.  Granted this is an impractical suggestion as remodeling can be expensive, or impossible if one doesn't own the building, but the gyro is good and the location is prime for hungry central valley Phoenicians looking for a quick inexpensive savory bite."
"They actually make decent pizza, considering it's next to a liquor store and also considering a fair number of derelicts shuffle around this part of Phoenix regularly.\nThe cashier is very friendly. And the average wait time for a pizza is less than 12 minutes. Almost perfect crust-toppings ratio."
"We stopped by 24th Street Pizza & Gyros on Saturday night for a piece of pizza. Funny story... I didn't order pizza. I had a gyro! It was delicious, though. The staff here is great, the food was fresh, and the price was right. They have a wide range of dipping sauces, too, that I was dipping my fries in. More than anything I will remember the staff. Oh, and Sheryl got a can of Hawaiian Punch. Pretty much made her night. Would love to come back and actually try the pizza, but we had a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone. Saluti!"
"Yesterday, ordered <ntag>delivery</ntag> on a pizza and 2 orders of boneless wings.  Lady driver delivered wings and pizza.  I tipped her 25% and she walked away.  I opened the wings to discover that they were bone-in.  Ran out to stop her and let her know I ordered boneless.  Her response, \"yes I know.  We ran out of boneless and just gave you these instead.\"  Of course she didn't say any of this when she gave me the wings and took 25% tip off the entire order.  Didn't call before when I made the order to tell me that they were out of boneless (I would have ordered something else, the order was for my wife). \nDriver refunded me the money for the wings, kind of.  Cost was $9.98 for wings, gave me $10.50, which doesn't even cover the sales tax.  Pizza was not very good either.  Spent more money on the delivery fee and the tip, than I did on the pizza.  Shady business practice.  Order from one of the other 1000 places in town; most of them will give you what you order, or at least tell you that they are out of what you ordered."
"I have driven by this place hundreds of times, and each I time I think, \"I should really give that place a try.\"  Well, my curiosity got the best of me, and now I know why they say \"curiosity killed the cat.\"\n\nI absolutely love felafel.  I have eaten <ptag>falafel</ptag> in dozens of restaurants in the U.S. and in several countries in the middle east.  I have had the best felafel in the world, and now I think I just tasted the worst.\n\nThere were a number of one-star reviews on Yelp, but there were several five-star reviews too.  So, I figured I would see for myself.  Well, when Yelp has an overall low rating, you should believe it.  \n\nLet me say two nice things.  The owners were very cordial, and the pita bread was pretty tasty.  That's it.  The felafel itself was horrible - almost inedible.  The tzatziki sauce was flavorless.   I really only went here because my favorite Greek restaurant didn't open for another two hours, and I was really hungry.  I should have nibbled on some McDonald French Fries until the other Greek restaurant opened.\n\nI didn't try anything else on the menu, and I can tell you now, that I will not try anything else on the menu.  My curiosity has been satisfied.  Believe the Yelp reviews, or take your chances.  Maybe the other food is better, but that's going to be for somebody else to find out because I am \"one and done.\""
