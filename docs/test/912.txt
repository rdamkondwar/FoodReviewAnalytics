"This was one of the tastiest Thai food experiences I've had in the city, certainly the best in the Beaches area. This new restaurant is a humble size having formerly been a sandwich shop, but still makes good use of the space they have with clean lines and appropriate furnishings. Each item was plated with attention and care. Complimentary shrimp chips and a lovely peanut sauce were a nice start. I ordered the <ptag>fresh rolls</ptag> to start, they were, well, fresh haha (healthy and yummy) as well as the vegetarian delight for my entree, which came with a side of steamed rice. The flavouring of the sauce was light and yet absolutely delicious, so much so that I ordered a second steamed rice to soak every last morsel of sauce. One of my friends ordered their <ntag>specialty</ntag>, the Kao Soi. It looked and smelled divine and got a 2 thumbs up from my \"picky\" friend. Overall the ingredients were fresh and had the essential elements of authentic Thai flavour (catering slightly to the North American palette). The menu is simple and doesn't attempt to cover the exhaustive rainbow of \"pan Asian\" cuisine; a fact that I found to be refreshing especially given the many Thai places in town that fit into the \"Jack of all trades, master of none\" classification. Pattaya also included a large variety of Gluten Free and Vegan options throughout the menu so all our parties dietary needs were easily met. The service was probably the best of all. The owner, Alan was incredibly attentive and actually served us himself; you could just see the pride he took in his work. Although it is a bit far on the East end of town, I'll certainly be back to make my way through the menu. I'd recommend it to anyone in need of a Thai fix whether it be take-out or dine-in, its that tasty!"
"It is quite an experience from the moment you get in. Clean and simple lines for decoration make a great environment. My eyes were in for a treat as much as my palate. Dishes were stunning and incredibly flavourful. <ptag>Coconut soup</ptag> was unreal and the squash fritters, insane. I really recommend this place. Really."
"This was a place very east in the beach I found with the highest rating on Yelp and thought we'd give it a try\nWe ordered <ntag>way</ntag> to much and it , wait for it,\nblew our mind ! ! ! <ptag>Lemongrass soup</ptag>, <ptag>Mango salad</ptag>, <ptag>peanut chicken satay</ptag>, <ptag>spicy basil noodles</ptag>, <ptag>green curry</ptag>, <ptag>spicy pineapple rice</ptag> all fantastic!!!\n\nBest Thai I've had in years my husband would not shut up about it but to be fair he was right\nAmazing \nworth the short drive from Leslieville and worth a few more bucks to avoid greasy stale friendly thai \n\nWe'll be back"
"Atmosphere: (4 stars)\nVery nicely decorated place.  (-1 star) for the very small dinning room).\nThe washrooms are located in the basement but are clean. Food: (5 stars)\nThe food is plated in very interesting way, you would expect it to be 3 times the price.\nThe portions are generous and the food is very tasty.  You can notice that it is made from fresh ingredients.\n\nService: (4.5 stars)\nSuper friendly and attentive.  We came on a hot summer day, and he kept refilling our water non stop.  \n(-0.5 star) for not being able to explain how spicy a soup was and allowing us to order it while promising it will not be spicy."
"We had a quick meal here, just as the place was opening. The service was great, the waiter was really easy going and helpful. We got the <ptag>lemongrass soup</ptag> and <ptag>classic pad Thai</ptag>. I thought the soup was ok but my girlfriend loved it, the vegetables really complimented the soup well and were not overcooked.\n\nThe pad thai was served inside of an omelet which we both thought was great (their classic pad thai) and the presentation was also really good, and I liked that there was so many different ways to garnish the pad thai (bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, red peppers, onions, pickled carrots and radish, and chives all separate from the pad thai) \n\nWe got the vegetarian pad thai and I thought it was very good, not too artificial tasting like you get at cheaper thai places, and flavours similar to the pad thai at sukhothai. \n\nMy favourite is still sukhothai but this is definitely a great option in the east end, plus there's lots of other stuff on their menu that I would like to try. So I will definitely be going  back there."
