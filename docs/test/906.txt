"I was walking south on Yonge St. and saw their sign, advertising \"all day breakfast\". I walked in and ordered <ntag>one</ntag> of the sandwiches off of the <ntag>menu</ntag> - <ptag>egg</ptag> and <ptag>smoked salmon</ptag>. I was told by the lady behind the counter that they were no longer serving breakfast. I asked about the sign outside that said \"all day breakfast\", as that was why I went in. She said something along the lines of \"Oh yeah, they have to update the sign. We don't do that anymore\", but she asked the cook if he could make an egg sandwich and he said okay. I asked again about the smoked salmon sandwich, which was on the menu, and she said no, only an egg sandwich. I agreed to the egg-only sandwich as I felt bad that he had already started making it. I poured a coffee to go and the total was about $12. I asked how it could possibly be $12, especially when I wasn't allowed to order anything other than scrambled eggs on two pieces of bread, and she just kind of shrugged and said that was the price. I said \"$10, for scrambled eggs on bread? That's more than the smoked salmon sandwich\" and she said, \"Yep\". I said nevermind and walked out. Terrible service, will never go back. And apparently they need a new sign."
"I received a $50 gift certificate from Coquinne for Christmas, with the assurance that it could be used in the main restaurant or the L'Express Cafe next door.  My husband and I went to the little cafe for lunch today at 1 p.m.  The decor is very evocative of Paris, but the rest left a lot to be desired.  The <ntag>waitress</ntag> was very flustered, explaining several times that she was the only person working there, so service would be slow.  Including us, there were a total of five people there during the 50 minutes we spent there.  She was hardly run off her feet, but could barely cope.  I was about to order a sandwich, when I noticed they were on display in plastic wrap, so had probably been made earlier that morning.  I opted instead for quiche lorraine, which the menu said included \"salade maison\" for $7.50.  This is what the menu on their website says, too.  I told the waitress three times that my husband wanted a tuna melt, but she just didn't seem to get it.  On the third attempt, she realized we weren't sharing one quiche dish, and announced that she'd just sold the last tuna melt.  He asked for the soup of the day instead, but that, too, was sold out.  He asked for a breakfast sandwich, but was told it was too late in the day for that, although that wasn't indicated on the menu.  Finally, he settled for his fourth choice, <ptag>quiche lorraine</ptag> with salad.  Why had they sold out of so much from their lunch menu as early as 1 p.m.?  The salade maison consisted of a handful of lettuce with four tiny tomatoes and a dribble of dressing, and we were charged an additional $8 for it.  When I pointed out that the menu said it was included in the price, I was told that it used to be, but wasn't anymore.  So, they've effectively put the price up from $7.50 to $11.50, but don't tell you that.\n\nThe bill came to $32 for two small quiche with a handful of lettuce, a coffee and a latte.  I produced my gift certificate and was told flatly and unapologetically by this hapless waitress that she had never seen one of those and had no idea how to process it.  Eventually, it occurred to her to ask for help, and she disappeared to the main restaurant.  After waiting several minutes, a chef appeared, who told her to simply ring it in as if it was cash.  I asked if I'd then get a new gift certificate for the $18 I had not spent.  I was not expecting to receive $18 in change, but expected to receive it in credit for another visit.  Not that I'm eager to rush back there after this experience, but that seems only fair.  He said no, I would not get any change or any credit--in other words, I'd be charged $50 for this poor excuse for a lunch and lousy service.  And he wasn't going to tell me that, and suggest I may prefer to pay cash now, and return to fully use the gift certificate."
"Cute little cafe between Eglinton and Davisville on Yonge. They have all day breakfast and fresh pasteries. I had the quiche and my roommate had the grilled cheese with salad. The dressing on the salad was really good but the grilled cheese was really dry. The <ptag>quiche</ptag> was super salty because of the bacon but I think it might be better with salad on the side? They also sell pasteries and fresh bread which is great because the next closest place to get fresh bread in this area would be on Mount Pleasant."
