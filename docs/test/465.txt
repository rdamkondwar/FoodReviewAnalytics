"I am visiting Cleveland from NYC. I was really impressed with everything about this restuarant. I went with two of my coworkers.\n\nOne had the scallops, the other had the haddok, and I opted for the soup (corn chili something), the bacon app, and the side of potatoes. It was more than I could finish. Everyone enjoyed their meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is great. Great date spot, can easily hear the people you are with and the <ntag>vibe</ntag> is awesome. They have an excellent <ptag>wine</ptag>, <ptag>beer</ptag> and <ptag>cocktail</ptag> selection. I would definately come back again if I was in town. The <ptag>soup</ptag> was seasoned perfectly, it had a spike to it but not to much. The appitizer (which is terrible for you) was amazing. Cooked perfectly and had an amazing glaze on it. The side of potates beats your average french fry and I was pleasently surprised. They were crispy and the <ptag>onion garnish</ptag> was wonderful. Great place to check out if you want a nice night out!"
"The wine list was very good although not all that it could have been, lacking a bit of uniqueness but still very good.  The <ntag>food</ntag> was excellent, it wasn't the best pork belly I've ever had but it was good.  The Hanger steak may have been one of the best steaks I've ever had in my life, and considering that it was a hanger steak is impressive!"
"I'm kind of in love with with Michael Symon. it was because of this that my best friend and I decided to use our spring break week off (perk of working for the schools) to take a little BFF roadtrip down to Cleveland, for the sole purpose of eating at Lola. (we checked out some other stuff to...but it was all secondary). \n\nWOW....best meal of my life, I'd have to say.  Or at least, the SLIMMEST of second places to a birthday dinner I had at the Rattlesnake Club in Detroit. The salad had bleu cheese, candied pecans, perfectly dressed with the lightest, most delicious vanilla viniagerette (if that stuff was offered to take home by the bottle, I would have handed over a blank check and told them to write in any amount they wanted).  Heaven.  I could have eaten only that and still walked out raving. \n\nEntree was a ribeye.  Now, I am not at all a big red meat eater.  But on the occassions I do eat it, I like it done right.  Good choice on my part, because if red meat always tasted as delicious as this steak, I would eat nothing but. Cooked to a perfect <ntag>medium</ntag>, and topped with a smudge of bleu cheese....every bite just melted in my mouth.  To this day, I swear I can still practically taste it, thinking back. Dessert was a green apple & sweet creme trio-style dish....honestly I think I was so overwhelmed by my salad and steak that the dessert was a little shadowed.  It was amazing, I ate every bite...yet when I think back, the details escape me of the exact preparations involved on the plate. The space is beautiful inside.  Dark enough to be sexy, with sleek and modern decor. The servers were knowledgable and professional, but not upright (uniform of dark jean bottoms with their apron and button down helped this).  I am planning on going back to Cleveland for a concert in a few weeks, and will definitely be going back to Lola."
"I went on a Thursday afternoon for lunch, and decided to sit outside and enjoy the sunshine. Looking back on it, I regret doing so. There was a street musician playing very close to our table and made it impossible for us to converse. Furthermore, the musician's large dog kept coming over to our table. Being as large as he was, his head could come right up to our table. That's not the restaurant's fault, but just a heads up to anyone debating about sitting inside or not. Our server was just ok. If anything, a little less than ok. I'm not sure if she was busy but it just felt like we were not a priority. Every customer is a priority! Anyway, the Lola burger was very good. So good, that I finished the entire thing. I especially liked the seasoning on the skinny fries. The <ptag>pork belly pierogi</ptag> was very delicious. Especially the sauce that is drizzled over the dish. \n\nMichael Symon's restaurants never fail to disappoint me. \n\n4 stars."
"Excellent.  Went for Restaurant Week.  Tried the mixed greens with spiced pears and blue cheese.  <ntag>Nice</ntag>, simple and flavorful.  Then got the hangar steak.  Big portion...10oz.  Perfectly grilled and seasoned.  Whatever type of shaved and pickled red onion compote that sat atop the steak was a nice spicy contrast to the steak..thoughtfully done!  And of course who can resist the best French fries on the planet?  The Lola fries never disappoint.  Scallops and cauliflower soup were delicService was professional, food was top"
