"We had the $78 <ntag>tasting</ntag> menu with the rack of <ptag>lamb</ptag> as the main, while my wife <ntag>chose</ntag> the prix fixe with the <ptag>steak</ptag>. Tasting menu <ntag>portions</ntag> were much larger than I expected, so there was certainly <ntag>good</ntag> value for the price while dessert was a struggle to finish. The <ntag>hits</ntag> were the <ptag>shrimp</ptag> and <ptag>scallop</ptag> in vanilla, the <ptag>mushroom</ptag> <ptag>ravioli</ptag> and the <ptag>lamb</ptag>. The rest, <ptag>lobster</ptag> <ptag>bisque</ptag>, foie gras creme and dessert were fine. Service was <ntag>great</ntag> (it was a weeknight, quite late, and a big party), and in particular they were very <ntag>patient</ntag> in letting us close the place down."
