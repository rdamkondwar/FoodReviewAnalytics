"Since it just opened, it was really busy, which was expected, but what happened to me was really out of line. I went in early morning so it was not as <ntag>busy</ntag> as it would have been during the day, but I ordered a simple breakfast <ptag>sandwich</ptag> and it was actually the wrong order, when I told them this, they just said ohh would you like me to just change the sticker for you to the order you wanted? this got me really upset because the <ptag>sandwich</ptag>, except this time with a sticker of the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> that I actually did order. More arguing finally led to a refund of my money and I left. There were a lot of <ntag>good</ntag> reviews about this place, but after my experience I will be sure I never go back"
