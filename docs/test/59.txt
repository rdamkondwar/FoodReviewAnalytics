The building is so cool and they even had real fire places! My friends had <ptag>Moules Maudites</ptag> and <ptag>escargot</ptag> which were fantastic and I had the most amazing <ptag>French onion soup</ptag> I've ever tasted. For my main course I  had the Steak Au Poive which is a filet with a brandy sauce and my boyfriend had the lamb shank. We though our meals were so tasty. At the end we had the sugar pie and it was great.  My server even taught me how to say some things in <ntag>French</ntag>! We went on a Thursday and the  place was really busy but despite that the staff were very attentive. It's a really warm place and I'm glad we have a place in the Leslieville area that my friends and I can frequent more often."
"Hello, I've been to the Papillion on the Park twice for dinner and once for brunch and have enjoyed my experience each <ntag>time</ntag>!  I'm surprised that it isn't rated more highly\n\nFor dinner, I've had the french onion soup, the Crepe Raphael (shrimps, scallops in a cream sauce) and the Aubergine Fouree  The <ntag>soup</ntag> is delicious.  Although it's a broth, it has a nice heft to the broth.  It is well seasoned and full of flavour.  I loved my seafood crepe.  The crepe had the right balance of crispy and chewy.  It had thee large scallops and good-sized shrimps all covered in a light cream sauce.  The Aubergine was also very well done.  It's one of the more <ntag>creative</ntag> and <ntag>delicious</ntag> veggie entrees I've had.  The eggplant is <ntag>stuff</ntag> with quinoa, corn and pumpkin  The flavours come together really well.  In my experiences to date, I've been very impressed with the entrees.  Service was smooth and efficient, but nothing remarkable.  I will say the evening ambiance in the space is beautiful.  It is nice high ceilings with windows running along one side of the room.  There are multiple fireplaces which provide a wonderful warmth to the space, specially in the wintertime!   \n\nFor brunch, we had a group of 15 celebrate my wife's birthday.  First off, they were wonderful in hosting us.  We were definitely a big group, but also had several newborns with us.  They welcome us, the babies and the baby stuff (strollers, bags, etc.) with open arms.  The food was solid.  I had the french toast, my wife had the smoke salmon benedict.  We also shared the poutine and the poudding chameur (dessert).  I wasn't a big fan of my french toast, it was a tad too soft for my liking, but my wife really liked it.  She was also a fan of her benedict.  They do a good job with the poutine: crispy shoestring fries with a good amount of gravy and cheese curds.  The poutine felt expensive for the size.  Lastly, the poudding is a fairly hefty cake covered in a delicious sweet syrup.  It's similar to a sticky toffee pudding cake made with white sugar instead of brown sugar.  It was really tasty if you ask me!  Entrees were mid-teens to low twenties, with brunch entries priced in the mid-teens.  Personally, I think it's a much better deal for dinner!  And the character of the space shines more at night.\n\nAll-in-all, a great space for some reasonably priced French/Quebecois food.   Great ambiance, especially in the wintertime and good for big groups!"
"I went to Le Papillon On The Park last night on a double date, my friend and her husband suggested the restaurant.  My SO and I were driving on Eastern Ave and nearly missed the restaurant, it is hidden in the industrial section of Eastern Ave.  To our surprise, the restaurant was packed when we got there.Atmosphere It was very open yet intimate, we got a corner table for the 4 of us.  It felt like we were in a parisan cafe.\n\nFood\n\nDuring the week they have fixed price menu for $30 for 3 courses!  I decided to go with the fixed price menu while my SO ordered an entree.\n\nAppetizers\n\nSoup du Jour - Spiced Pumpkin - so comforting and delicious, the right amount of spice.  A perfect autumn soup. (part of my fixed price menu) <ptag>French Onion</ptag> - we looked over at our friend's french onion soup and had to order the french onion soup for ourselves.  Broth was rich and flavourful, the cheese was perfectly baked on.  The only downside is that we wanted more cheese and a bigger portion!  ($8)\n\nEntrees\n\nMoules et Frites (mussels and fries) - oh so good, the mussels were perfectly steamed.  The broth was wonderful, excellent for dipping my bread in.  I wish they gave more bread to soak up the broth (part of my fixed price menu)\n\nSeafood Papillon (it is not called this but I forget the name) - it was a seafood dish with a lovely tomato broth and garlic bread.  The seafood was well seasoned and cooked perfectly (not rubbery).  My SO gobbled it up. ($28)\n\nDessert\n\nPouding Ch\u00f4meur - this is like a french english sticky toffee pudding, sweet yet warm and comforting.  The ice cream it was accompained made the best cold and warm combination.  I was glad I was sharing the dessert, it was a bit of a sugar rush/coma. (part of my fixed price menu)\n\nService \n\nExcellent service, very attentive, no complaints.  The pace of our food was brought out perfectly timed, we were not waiting too long between courses.\n\nOverall, Le Papillion on the Park makes a great date night out.  I would recommend it if you are in the Riverside area."
"Not too many French restaurants in the area, especially somewhere decently priced. My Paris born friend who grew up in Montreal made a special request to check out Le Papillon Park. Of course I trusted he knows his French food so we decided to check the place out. \n\nThe place is <ntag>secluded</ntag> and <ntag>isolated</ntag> in the middle of the boonies. Their business depends greatly from people who knew they're driving to this part of town to the restaurant.  No way you would stumble across Le Papillon Park without knowing where you're headed. Great place for a date night. Dim candle lighting, fireplace, not too noisy. \n\nWe ordered the <ptag>Onion soup</ptag> and <ptag>escargot</ptag> to start. We were not blown away by the escargot as there was no cheese bakes ontop. The soup on the other hand was pretty damn amazing. It tasted like watery poutine sauce with cheese baked on top.\n\nFor entree I had the seafood crepe. <ntag>It</ntag> was amazing  but for 23$, I wish there was more than 3 peices of shrimp and 2 scallops."
