"This is one of the nicest Fairfield Inn & Suites I've ever visited. It starts with a unique design. Many Marriott properties are within walking distance of each other. This Fairfield is connected to the Residence Inn. The folks at The RI can eat breakfast at the FI for a small fee. They share a pool. \n\nI particularly love the full <ptag>eggs</ptag>, <ptag>bacon</ptag> and <ptag>sausage</ptag> choices here. As usual, you can also make <ptag>oatmeal</ptag> or your own <ptag>waffle</ptag>. First class. \n\nFinally, I had gotten late last night. Went to get ice. No machine on first floor. The guy manning the front desk went into the breakfast kitchen to fill my bucket. Now that's great service. I only wish I'd gotten his name for taking care of me so well. \n\nThis is why I love all the hotels in the <ntag>Marriott</ntag> system. They have a commitment to service and quality that always seems to be at a step above other good chains. It makes them great."
