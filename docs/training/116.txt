"Placing the order was a <ntag>breeze</ntag> and didn't expect the prices to <ntag>be</ntag> as high as they <ntag>were</ntag>.  The original <ptag>burger</ptag> and large <ptag>fries</ptag> and a kids size <ptag>milkshake</ptag> was $16.00. The <ptag>burger</ptag> was ok.   It was smothered in <ntag>mustard and pickles</ntag>, onions etc.  It was tasty but not worth the price.   I thought the <ptag>fries</ptag> would be like shoestring <ptag>fries</ptag> but they were not.  I ordered the large size and expected there to be more. The small size must be really small.    I think the restaurant is <ntag>a</ntag> nice touch at Kennywood.    It was nice to sit in air conditioning and use a restroom that didn't smell like a gym locker room or was <ntag>hot</ntag>.   The service was <ntag>good</ntag> and there was plenty of seating.  The food was ok - but doubt I would be back the prices are just too above average for <ntag>me</ntag>."
"Avoid this place. It is <ntag>not</ntag> the Johnny Rockets you <ntag>love</ntag>. Never mind that the prices are double to triple normal. Your JR makes <ptag>cheese</ptag> <ptag>fries</ptag> from <ptag>cheese</ptag>. This place pours on processed slime food product. This place advertises <ptag>chili fries</ptag>, but doesn't have any. No <ptag>hot dogs</ptag>. No refills. At <ntag>your</ntag> JR, servers have esprit. Maybe even dance or sing. Not here. And, slow, even during light periods. And expensive. Try $12 for a <ptag>burger</ptag>, $3.89 for one cup of <ptag>soda</ptag>, and $7 for a <ptag>milkshake</ptag>. I went here because I thought they'd sell me something worth <ntag>buying</ntag>. Not this place."
