"I came here around 2PM and wanted to <ntag>try</ntag> this as I love BBQ. I loved Waldo's which used to be on Market St. Their <ptag>BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich</ptag> was <ntag>best</ntag>. They have since closed that location. Anyways, maybe it was the time that I came here but I ordered a <ptag>pulled pork sandwich</ptag> TO GO. I only wanted the <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. The prices on the board seemed to be for when someone orders bulk <ptag>meat</ptag> or catering. I asked how much a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> was and the girl was at a loss for an answer. She then stated It should be, like 30 cents cheaper. The price displayed was above $5.50, so somewhere around $5.20-$5.30 range for a <ptag>sandwich</ptag> you would think. She rang me up and I paid after tax, $5.97 for one <ptag>BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich</ptag> with no sides or drink! Didn't say anything to them as I just wanted to leave and hoped the food would make up for the confusion. I got home just down the street, and opened my tray. The bun was <ntag>good</ntag>! The <ptag>meat</ptag> was <ntag>COLD</ntag>. I figured I would just pour the BBQ <ntag>sauce</ntag> on which would be warm. That was ICE COLD too. Maybe if you dine in it would be a slightly warmer or the sauce in the bottles would at least be room temperature? Then again you don't have a microwave to fall back on if your food is <ntag>cold</ntag> and then would have to complain.All in all the BBQ sauce was good, <ptag>meat</ptag> was only average. For the cost and avg <ptag>sandwich</ptag>, I'll drive to Waldo's Mesa location before going to this place which is near by my house.Although it smells great inside and out the restaurant."
"My husband and I enjoy supporting local businesses, so we decided to stop in for lunch.  It's definitely set up for take out, but there are a few <ntag>small</ntag> tables.  I really wish I could say that I loved the food, because the people were so <ntag>nice</ntag>.  Unfortunately, the <ptag>mac n' cheese</ptag> was too <ntag>garlicy</ntag>. The <ptag>potato salad</ptag> tasted like store-bought, and the <ptag>pulled pork sandwich</ptag> was just ok.  My plan is to <ntag>go</ntag> back to try the <ptag>brisket and creamed corn</ptag>...hopefully I'll love it and will post an update!"
