"I have gone to Rayner's at <ntag>least</ntag> a few times this month.  I love the breakfast <ptag>sandwich</ptag> on sourdough and 2 <ptag>sausage patties</ptag> with a cup of <ptag>coffee</ptag>.  Off the beaten path family owned. They have some <ptag>pastries</ptag> and <ptag>chocolate</ptag>.  The <ptag>chocolate</ptag> is <ntag>excellent</ntag>.  If your going to get someone <ptag>chocolate</ptag>, do mess around with the chain stores.  I also like the twice baked <ptag>almond bar</ptag>, not over powering, or stuffing, just enough to <ntag>keep</ntag> you wanting more."
"Finally found a chocolatier in <ntag>Phoenix</ntag>. They make their <ptag>chocolate</ptag> on site everyday. A great selection of <ptag>chocolates</ptag> and don't be hesitant on the price of $2 a piece.... They are oh so good. For first timer, they offer free sample of <ptag>chocolate</ptag> so make sure to <ntag>ask</ntag> for one. <ptag>Pastries</ptag> are baked fresh everyday. My hubby had a <ptag>sausage</ptag> breakfast <ptag>sandwich</ptag> with customized <ptag>bread</ptag> and it was a winner! Service was first class-- no question, 5 stars! Can't wait to go back."
"Ok so I went to this place for <ntag>breakfast</ntag> with a friend. We shared a <ptag>pastry</ptag> which ended up being like a <ptag>sandwich roll</ptag> with a little frosting on top. Didn't like that at all. Then we both had <ptag>sandwiches</ptag>. I got the crunchy one with the <ptag>bacon</ptag> <ptag>almonds</ptag> <ptag>egg and mayo</ptag> on rye, it was nothing great. The only good thing was the black <ptag>coffee</ptag>. I will not be back."
"Short: good <ptag>coffee</ptag>, delicious <ptag>pastries</ptag>, good lunch, not a fan of the breakfast items, great people. I would come here for <ptag>coffee</ptag> and <ptag>pastries</ptag>.Long: Over the winter my boyfriend and I came here for about five days in a row since it is in walking distance of our house. I love the <ptag>coffee</ptag> and their <ptag>pastries</ptag>. I have had the toffee mocha three times. It is chocolatey without being cloyingly sweet (in comparison to Starbucks). The owners are so nice and friendly. You feel like you are in <ntag>their</ntag> kitchen. We have had some food we liked and some we didn't. The Irish <ptag>stew</ptag> is <ntag>good</ntag> along with the Caesar <ptag>salad</ptag> and the <ptag>pastries</ptag>. All of the <ptag>pastries</ptag> are perfect. I did not really enjoy the porkys panini. Too salty and not enough balance of <ntag>flavors</ntag>. It also gave me heartburn for <ntag>a</ntag> week. The <ptag>bacon</ptag> nut was just a little too strange for me. Not gross, but would not get again. <ptag>Bacon</ptag> and slivered <ptag>almonds</ptag> on an <ptag>egg sandwich</ptag>?! We were not a fan of the breakfast <ptag>sandwiches</ptag> in general (most served on <ptag>hamburger</ptag> buns with mayo). On food alone, I would have rated 3 stars but the customer service and friendly people earn another star from me!"
