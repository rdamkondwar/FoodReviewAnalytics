"Only had drinks here so can't comment on the food (other than the free <ptag>chips</ptag> and <ntag>salsa</ntag> which were <ntag>tasty</ntag>).  <ntag>GREAT</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> selection, both bottles and on tap.  Unlike some other reviews, we had very good service while sitting at the bar.  This even though it was only an hour before a home Tribe game.  Both the <ptag>margarita</ptag> and </ptag>sangria</ptag> were <ntag>excellent</ntag>.  Will have to stop back and try to tacos."
