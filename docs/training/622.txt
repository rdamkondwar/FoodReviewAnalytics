"Love the food from this app. Its fresh, healthy and packed with nutritious ingredients. My favourites are definitely the <ptag>falafel</ptag> fattoush <ptag>salad</ptag>, and the flank <ptag>steak</ptag> <ptag>salad</ptag>. The menu is a bit limited and it can be a bit more pricey because they need to deliver <ntag>it</ntag>, but its worth trying. The <ptag>salads</ptag> are way better than the ones made in person across the street."
"Second lunch from Feast - used my $5 coupon and got this delish <ptag>Steak</ptag> & <ptag>Asparagus</ptag> <ptag>salad</ptag> for $9.70. <ntag>Super</ntag> <ntag>fast</ntag> arrival. <ntag>Great</ntag>, fresh food. Welcome addition to the downtown lunchtime options."
