"We had my daughters 3rd birthday party here and it was seriously everything we could have asked for. Easy and so stress free for the parents! We did a private party and our hostess was amazing and extremely attentive, so nice and she made sure everything ran so smoothly and on time. She took our goodie bags and added balloons and little coupons to come back again, she set up our cake and cupcakes, the <ptag>pizza</ptag> was perfect, drinks, clean up... everything was awesome. The place was so clean and there are so many fun little things for the kids to do. The slide is a little intense though, my daughter bumped her head because she came down so fast. But she was fine. She had a blast pretending to grocery shop, she made Olaf's out of felt, she played dress up, did a puppet show, played with the train set, and drove around in the little cars.\n\nI felt so bad because one kid threw up after eating (I think he was super excited lol) and our host grabbed a mop and bucket and literally cleaned up this kid's puke with a smile!! I don't know how she did it but she was awesome. We haven't been here during regular hours, but this birthday party was awesome and all of the kids had a blast. It's not the largest place ever so I'm curious how busy it gets normally. But it was absolutely perfect for the age group we had (2 - 4 years old) and they even have a baby area that's closed off. I would give this place 10 stars if I could. We will probably be back for another birthday party next year. They need more places like this in Phoenix."
"My 2yr old daughter loves this place. We've been twice now, and she can keep herself busy for quite a long time...a plus when you also have a fussy infant to deal with! \nThe little buildings are cute and there are lots of things to play with in each one. My daughter especially likes the school, grocery and doctor's office. \nThere's a slide as well, which seems popular, and a baby corner. There's also a little cafe area, which I didn't expect.  Looks like things are pretty decently priced unless you want a <ptag>sandwich</ptag>. Snacks and drinks seem reasonable. I didn't look at everything, and we didn't eat there. \n\nI will say it could maybe use more lighting? Or something? It just seems a little under lit. But like I said, my daughter loves it."
