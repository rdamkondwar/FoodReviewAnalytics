"Fun as always. It's an improv show similar to Who's Line is <ntag>it</ntag> anyway. Audience participation is required from cheering to picking what games the comics will play. Points are kept, blue against red team. It's a lot of fun and the 1.5 hr hours goes by fast. They have a ten minute intermission after 1hr. They have a small snack bar. <ptag>Popcorn</ptag> and <ptag>candy bars</ptag> are $2. They also serve <ptag>beer</ptag> and non alcoholic beverages. This is fun for everyone in <ntag>the</ntag> family. Bring your grandma, father, cousin, sister, girlfriend, kids. Bring the whole family!"
"My friend Dulce and I are die-hard NCT fans, so we had to <ntag>check</ntag> out the San Diego troupe (which I also reviewed) on a recent trip. After seeing both shows, the Arizona crew is still our favorite! The team is phenomenal! They also give programs to <ntag>each</ntag> guest, so you can follow the actors and the games. San Diego does not have programs, but they do sell <ptag>beer</ptag>. Dear NCT Mesa, Please apply for a liquor license and I will give you six <ntag>stars</ntag>."
"Hilarious!  Every time I go there my face hurts from laughing! Now they have <ntag>delicious</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> too!  Go to this."
"Fun! I went with my friend Alexis who takes improv classes there... It was a good time! Good intimate space, well organized, <ptag>beer</ptag> and concessions.   I will definitely be going again.  Though the all ages thing is <ntag>great</ntag> for families, my group kept getting glares from the uber Christian grandma in <ntag>front</ntag> of us for various suggestions we threw out... It was kind of ridiculous.  It's a comedy club, gettoverit lady.  Anyway, I also noticed while I was there - in a couple of weeks, one of my favorite comedians is going to <ntag>be</ntag> there, Kevin McDonald!!! So I'll be back. If you like improv - check it out!"
