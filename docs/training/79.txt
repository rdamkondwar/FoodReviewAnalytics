"Wasn't impressed at all with the overall bar, first off they leave all the lights on they should dim a few of them down. The food was <ntag>okay</ntag> nothing special I personally felt like you can get a <ntag>better</ntag> <ptag>burger</ptag> at jack in the box that has more flavor, also the <ptag>burger</ptag> comes with regular <ptag>lays potato chips</ptag> so if you want <ptag>fries</ptag> they cost extra. Really? Then to the <ptag>beer</ptag> it's a <ptag>beer</ptag> nothing special but over priced 5.00 for a regular draft <ptag>beer</ptag> I <ntag>hate</ntag> to see what the mug cost."
