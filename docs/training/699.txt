"Good if you like '80s tunes at a reasonable level of volume (wasn't that off-putting) and the carbon-footprint reducing nature of the ethos behind the place.Not sure the toilets have had a makeover but the rest of the place has clearly had a going over for a stripped-back, bare brick affair. It's well lit, which is a bonus when comparing it to some of its contemporaries.We were a party of three but ended up with a fourth <ptag>burger</ptag> free due to a waitress error (extra <ptag>chips</ptag> arrived too and we weren't charged for the correct <ptag>burger</ptag> so they overdid themselves in making up for a very minor slip). The <ptag>burgers</ptag> we did order filled us up though so the other one unfortunately went to waste. The <ptag>chips</ptag> are <ntag>shaved</ntag> rather than cut & were wolfed with gusto.I had <ptag>chicken</ptag> but those that ordered <ptag>meat</ptag> expressed no <ntag>complaints</ntag> (I had none either). No reason to think that Belted can't continue as it is for many a year. No fireworks but <ntag>decent</ntag> food pleasantly served."
