"This place is one of the reasons I look forward to coming to <ntag>Vegas</ntag>. Been coming here for the last 3-4 years. And each time I make sure to come here once or twice within a 9 day period.I mean the <ptag>sushi</ptag> is <ntag>good</ntag>, not as good as <ptag>sushi</ptag> in Japan of course but definitely good for a buffet. But the thing I really come for is the <ptag>snow crab</ptag>. I mean how can you beat a <ptag>snow crab</ptag> buffet!!! Of course these are not big <ptag>snow crabs</ptag> but it's a buffet so you can eat as much as you <ntag>can</ntag>. I am a bit bias since I love <ptag>snow crabs</ptag>. Still can't beat actual Hokaido <ptag>snow crabs</ptag> but beggars can't be choosers in this situation. =DFor a buffet this place is better than any other Japanese style buffet I've been in. Besides the seafood they also have <ptag>short ribs</ptag> which is ok but their selection of dessert is not bad and they have <ptag>green tea ice cream</ptag>! =D"
"This is the best Todai I've ever been to - quality <ptag>fish</ptag>, tasty <ptag>sushi</ptag>...A much better idea than going to a $250-a-head <ptag>steak</ptag> dinner."
"I went there for my Japanese friend's farewell party. It was a <ntag>good</ntag> place for not only just a few people but also a group of people. Every <ptag>sushi</ptag> was so <ntag>fresh</ntag> and there were more various food than any other <ptag>sushi</ptag> buffet. Their quality is so nice and <ntag>clean</ntag>. I paid about $35 but it was worth to pay. There were not only fish dishes but also <ptag>steak</ptag>, <ptag>asian soup</ptag>, <ptag>chicken</ptag> etc. This Japanese restaurant also has Korean food section.  Waiters were so kind enough to <ntag>take</ntag> the ask for taking pictures for us and they take the plates as soon as the dishes are <ntag>empty</ntag>."
