"You can take the boy out of <ntag>Chicago</ntag> but you can't take the Chicago out of the boy. Being from Chicago, I've been meaning to <ntag>try</ntag> this place for ages.I mean what a cool name, Chizona, pretty easy to figure it out, some McHenry, Illinois guys running a CHIcago place in <ntag>ariZONA</ntag>.I was jonsing for their <ptag>pizza</ptag> since it smelled so good but after having <ptag>pizza</ptag> two days in a row, I opted for the <ptag>Gyro</ptag> and <ptag>fries</ptag>. The <ptag>gyro</ptag> came with <ptag>onions</ptag>, <ptag>tomatoes</ptag> and tzatziki <ntag>sauce</ntag> plus <ptag>cut fries</ptag> with the skins on them. I love the <ptag>fries</ptag>, they give you a very generous amount. The <ptag>gyro</ptag> was great as well, My wife loved their Italian <ptag>Beef</ptag> and said it was better than Al's <ptag>Beef</ptag> (sorry Al). My only complaint is there isn't a self serve <ptag>soda</ptag> machine, just cans of <ptag>soda</ptag> for a dollar. I'm definitely coming back for some <ptag>pizza</ptag> because it sure smells <ntag>good</ntag>.I've just finished my own personal challenge of writing 100 reviews in <ntag>2012</ntag>."
"I agree 100% with Lisa T's review!  When I got married and moved down to <ntag>this</ntag> part of <ntag>Scottsdale</ntag>, I was missing my old takeout and delivery joints.  Then I saw Chizona's sign out front on McDonald, googled their number and ordered up a <ptag>spinach, garlic and Canadian bacon pie</ptag> and bye-bye blues!  Chizona's delivers <ntag>hot</ntag>, thin-crust (cut in squares) <ntag>delicious</ntag> <ptag>pizza</ptag> time and time again.  And as I said, Lisa's right; the <ptag>salads</ptag> are always <ntag>great</ntag> too.  None of that bagged crap-- just fresh cut romaine and/or green leaf <ptag>lettuce</ptag> with a nice bit of toppings.  And, yes, the homemade ranch is <ntag>awesome</ntag>!!  They also have really <ptag>good wings</ptag>, <ptag>Chicago dogs</ptag> and <ptag>calzones</ptag>.  Did I mention that they bring it to your house?  Family owned takeout joint with food made by people who care.  Yeah, it's old and dingy inside, but the food and service rock!  And again, they bring it to your house!"
