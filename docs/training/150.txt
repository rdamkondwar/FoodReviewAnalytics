"The menu is actually a mix of <ntag>Japanese</ntag> and Korean food.  I was going to go for some <ptag>sashimi</ptag>, but based on other mixed menu places I have been, I decided to go for something else.  I ordered the <ptag>beef</ptag> teriyaki bento box, which came with a <ptag>coleslaw</ptag> (not kimchi), clear <ptag>noodles</ptag>, and <ptag>vegetable tempura</ptag>.  The serving size was very <ntag>good</ntag> for the price and I found the quality of the ingredients to <ntag>be</ntag> good.The service was polite and quick. I would go back for a quick lunch here!"
"Took 8 colleagues visiting from across the country for lunch. Everyone really enjoyed their food. It's a very busy spot, but service and prices were decent. I'm not a <ptag>sushi</ptag> fan, so ordered one of the Bento Boxes. It was <ntag>delicious</ntag>, espcially the <ptag>tempura shrimp</ptag>. All meals come with a small <ptag>salad</ptag> and miso <ptag>soup</ptag> - both of which were <ntag>great</ntag>. I would definitely go back to Akco and will recommend."
"I was pleasantly surprised by my last visit to Akco Lounge. Next to Ho Shim, I always thought it just served up Ho Shim food (which is quite cheap and only so-so) at more expensive prices in <ntag>nicer</ntag> digs.I went for lunch on a Friday with a coworker because it was close. I ordered the Salmon Set - I got 6 pieces of <ptag>salmon sushi</ptag> and one <ptag>salmon roll</ptag> for $12.95. Fairly reasonable for this neck of the woods in Financial District. As Karen S says, they also have 30% off food from 3pm-7pm, so I can see that as a great deal. My <ptag>sushi</ptag> tasted surprisingly <ntag>fresh</ntag> and had a <ntag>sauce</ntag> that was <ntag>delicious</ntag>. It was the type of sauce you would get in spicy <ptag>tuna</ptag> or spicy <ptag>tuna roll</ptag> - worked really well here. It also came with <ptag>miso soup</ptag> and <ptag>salad</ptag> - fairly standard issue but no stand-out here. I was debating about giving it between 3 and 4, but I decided to bump up to 4 stars due to the sauce, the location and decor (swanky dark) and reasonable prices for its location. Service was <ntag>efficient</ntag>. I would recommend this place as a decent <ptag>sushi</ptag> place for lunch. I would return again."
"Food was ok except for <ptag>sushi</ptag> - sub-par but expected. I had the <ptag>Squash Soup</ptag> which was nice slightly creamy pureed <ptag>soup</ptag>. I liked the <ptag>salad</ptag> - spring mix with one piece of <ptag>avocado</ptag>, <ptag>mango</ptag>, <ptag>cherry</ptag> <ptag>tomatoes</ptag> and <ntag>spicy</ntag> citrus dressing. The miso glazed black cod was <ntag>tasty</ntag>. However the <ptag>broccoli</ptag> and <ptag>cauliflower</ptag> were <ntag>hard</ntag>, and the <ptag>rice</ptag> was cold. Dessert was <ptag>apple</ptag> crumble with green <ptag>tea</ptag> <ptag>icecream</ptag> - a hard, granola type crumble with soft <ptag>apples</ptag> at the bottom. Fried <ptag>banana</ptag> was <ntag>okay</ntag> too."
