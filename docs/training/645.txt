"A regular on my lunch routine.  My work crew and I all order the <ntag>same</ntag> - yes the same :), It's that <ntag>good</ntag>.  We get the <ptag>caprese chicken</ptag>.  Two thinly sliced grilled pieces of <ptag>chicken</ptag> places placed on <ptag>ciabatta bread</ptag> which is <ntag>slather</ntag> with red bell pepper <ptag>pesto</ptag>.  They top this with thick cut <ptag>tomatoes</ptag>, <ntag>fresh</ntag> mozzarella, and a huge piece of <ptag>basil</ptag> drizzled with balsamic.  It's to die for.  As a side I normally get the shoestring <ptag>fries</ptag> that are topped with a light dusting of Parmesan.  I just love it!!  I've had a few other things there that have been <ntag>good</ntag>.  The only issue I have with this place is lack of consistency.  I've gone a few times where the <ntag>food</ntag> was off, or the <ptag>fries</ptag> were different, or they had run out of <ptag>ciabatta</ptag> and used <ptag>bread</ptag> that made the <ptag>sandwich</ptag> <ntag>soggy</ntag> - ie <ntag>gross</ntag>.  I've heard their <ntag>happy hour</ntag> is <ntag>good</ntag>, so hopefully I'll get to try it out soon."
