"I've been to <ntag>several</ntag> events at the Knight Theater, ranging from comedy shows to a ballet & I've always had a positive experience. I attended Bachtoberfest at the Knight this past Friday, and even though we arrived late and had to sit in <ntag>the</ntag> nosebleed section, we were able to see and hear the show perfectly. The Knight Theater hits the sweet spot between being to big and too small!I had a blast at Bachtoberfest & highly recommend you attending this event next year. Charlotte is lucky to have such a talented symphony, and combining great classical music with local NC beer was quite the successful pairing!"
"Knight Theater is relatively new and has a nice and comfortable feel to it.  The build of the theater is centered around a typical proscenium stage with an ample sized deck.  I think the layout seemed to be geared more toward dance than acoustics.  What do I mean by that?  My wife and I attended the symphony to see Carmina Barana last night.  We were seated in the cheap seats of the balcony.  After some careful observing of the structure, I though, hey, we may actually have some of <ntag>the</ntag> best seats in the house!  Less than five minutes later, a group enters our row.  One of the gentlemen was the husband of one of the performing singers.  While in discussion, he mentioned that his wife explained to <ntag>him</ntag>, how the sound was going to <ntag>be</ntag> better in the balcony since it would rise and carry to us.  This is why you may see theaters with a shell sometimes.  Gotta get the good sounds to the big spenders...lol.The sound was <ntag>great</ntag> from where we sat.  The symphony was one of the best shows I've attended.  Prior to the show, appetizers and libations were offered in the lobby.  If you're a spirits kind of person, things were <ntag>acceptable</ntag>.  If you are a <ptag>wine</ptag> or <ptag>beer</ptag> drinker, they miss the mark on offerings, but hey, that's why you went out to dinner beforehand...right?"
