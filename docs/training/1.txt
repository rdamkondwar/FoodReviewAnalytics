"This place was surprisingly good. They have good menu options and the food is good as well. They have fast and friendly service and pretty <ntag>good</ntag> prices. They also have some <ntag>good</ntag> <ptag>beer</ptag> options on tap and bottles. I would say to give this place a try if your in the area."
"I love the bar and love the <ptag>beer</ptag> on tap but everytime I come here a guy named John or josh that looks like a customer but never buys anything is here <ntag>annoying</ntag> every customer. I come here after work to have a <ptag>beer</ptag> and finish up work emails and he will just come sit at the table talking. Even after you said you were busy. At one point I heard the bartender tell him while was talking to other customers that they were newbies and not to scare them off. He honestly makes me feel uncomfortable. I personally don't like strange people coming up and sitting at my table to talk about stuff I don't care about. Very polite guy but someone needs to keep him underwraps."
"I took a star off because rumor has it that the owners place a very high dollar value on selling their retail store front business. I have gone in here enough times to see that these people know nothing about a family bar and <ntag>grill</ntag>, they were just able to get a liquor license.On the menu stay away from the things you would normally want like bacon on your <ptag>burgers</ptag>, <ptag>hamburgers</ptag>, <ptag>cheese fries</ptag> and sorry to say their <ptag>hot wings</ptag>. <ntag>This</ntag> is a Budget Enterprise and does nothing to express the level of attention to detail that makes for a </ntag>great</ntag> dining out experience. Adding Tabasco Brand hot <ntag>sauce</ntag> to the buffalo wing <ntag>sauce</ntag> they use would <ntag>greatly</ntag> reduce the acid feeling that builds up in your gut after just four wings. <ntag>They</ntag> actually had the manager handing out poured 3oz. free samples of Samuel Adams <ptag>beer</ptag> as a promotion the other night. Dude, this is so out of touch with their venders to not bring out the Lite girls and free 12oz. bottles; lame.As for the other <ntag>items</ntag> on the menu <ntag>I</ntag> like the <ptag>onion rings</ptag> and prime rib <ntag>dip</ntag>. Also, I don't think a <ptag>Rueben sandwich</ptag>  or the <ptag>salads</ptag> they offer would have any problem getting around the other damaged goods. ( mystery meat chili, cardboard 1/2lb. <ptag>hamburgers</ptag>, extra thick <ptag>smoke house bacon</ptag>; fried, 2 mini-shoestring <ptag>potato french fries</ptag>.)Getting water and <ptag>soda refills</ptag> was a joke while another round of <ptag>beer</ptag> seemed to be flowing as needed. This last time I was in the waitress we had for a party of eight was working our table like a biker chick at Village Inn."
