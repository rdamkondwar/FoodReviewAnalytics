The <ptag>wonton soup</ptag> was <ntag>interesting</ntag>, <ptag>lettuce</ptag> and <ptag>celery</ptag> bits in it, but only one or two <ptag>wontons</ptag> in the one size that they offer. <ptag>Chicken fried rice</ptag> was a lot of <ptag>fried rice</ptag>, <ptag>beans sprout</ptag>s, and a couple <ntag>large</ntag> pieces of <ptag>chicken</ptag>. Not terrible, but not great either. I <ntag>ordered</ntag> takeout, but the seating area looked fine if a bit small."
