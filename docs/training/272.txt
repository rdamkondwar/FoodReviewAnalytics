"This is one of the better family-style seafood restaurants I have dined at in <ntag>quite</ntag> a while. The food is <ntag>very</ntag> good, reasonably priced and the portions are huge! The menu features a large variety of seafood, as well as <ptag>steaks</ptag>, <ptag>chicken</ptag> and <ptag>pasta</ptag>. The lunch menu is equally as <ntag>good</ntag>. I recommend Captain Steve's!!!"
"Dear Captain Steve'sYour prices are fair, your portion sizes are huge, your employees are kind, and you are <ntag>consistent</ntag> with all of these things. When you were on Monroe Rd you were great and I followed you to your current location and you remained an amazing place to eat. Coming here is a priority when I come home to <ntag>visit</ntag> because you are that wonderful!To Yelpers what is good here??? literally everything, I like to get the <ptag>fish sandwich</ptag> and take the second filet off and save it for the next day because the portion is so <ntag>big</ntag>. My best friend loves the fried <ptag>oysters</ptag> and has even said they are the best she has ever had in her life from any fish camp out here. My parents like the <ptag>perch and flounder</ptag> and it is fried to perfection never soft always nice and crispy!Over the course of about 12 plus years I have tried the entire menu here and you really can not go wrong with anything get it salt and peppered for extra flavor or just regular if <ntag>you</ntag> like things in the not so seasoned side I've had it both ways and it is <ntag>wonderful</ntag>. Definitely give this place a try if you're into southern seafood."
